# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Refining_Database_Schema_For_Trading_Robot_Platform**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The primary objective was to refine and improve the database schema for the Trading Robot Plug project, ensuring it meets the demands of scalability, security, and efficiency.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Reviewed the existing project overview and current database schema to identify areas for improvement.
  - Proposed a new database schema with better normalization, the use of UUIDs for primary keys, and enhanced security measures like encryption of sensitive data.
  - Included new tables to handle technical indicators, subscription plans, and audit logs, all designed to improve the project's overall robustness and scalability.
  
- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - A challenge was balancing normalization with performance, especially in a high-volume, real-time financial trading application. The breakthrough came with the decision to partition large tables and use indexed foreign keys, which will enhance query performance without compromising data integrity.
  
- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The refined schema provides a solid foundation for future development, with clear pathways for scaling, adding new features, and maintaining data security. This will significantly contribute to the project's ability to handle increased user loads and more complex trading algorithms.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Database Design:** Enhanced schema normalization and ensured the use of appropriate data types and indexing for optimized performance.
- **Security Best Practices:** Applied encryption for sensitive data fields and implemented role-based access control to manage user permissions.
- **Project Management:** Coordinated the review and improvement process, ensuring alignment with the project’s long-term goals.
- **SQL Optimization:** Leveraged partitioning and indexing strategies to prepare the database for high-performance demands.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between database normalization and performance in a high-demand environment.
  - Learned the importance of designing a flexible and scalable schema that can evolve with the project’s needs.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Managing potential performance bottlenecks due to the high volume of real-time financial data. The solution involved a combination of partitioning large tables and optimizing indexing strategies.
  
- **Future Application:** 
  - Future database work will incorporate these insights, particularly the need for balancing normalization with performance and preparing the schema for scaling from the outset.

---

## To-Do
- **Finalize Schema Documentation:** Complete the documentation for the updated database schema, ensuring all changes are well-documented for future reference.
- **Implement Schema Changes:** Begin implementing the new schema in the development environment and run tests to ensure everything functions as expected.
- **Monitor Performance:** After implementation, monitor database performance under load to ensure the changes have the desired effect.
- **Plan for Data Migration:** Develop a strategy for migrating existing data to the new schema with minimal downtime.

## Code Snippets and Context
### Example Code for Partitioning Financial Data
```sql
CREATE TABLE Financial_Data (
    data_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol_id UUID REFERENCES Symbols(symbol_id),
    date DATE,
    open_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    close_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    high_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    low_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    volume BIGINT,
    additional_data JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (date);
```
This snippet demonstrates how the `Financial_Data` table has been partitioned by the `date` field to improve query performance.

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Future Schema Updates:** Consider adding automated processes for archiving old data that is no longer frequently accessed, to maintain database performance.
- **Project Direction:** The project is on track, and the improved schema will support more advanced features as the project transitions from beta to production.

---

## Project Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Initial setup and configuration - Completed
- **Milestone 2:** Data fetch module implementation - In Progress
- **Milestone 3:** Schema redesign and implementation - Next Steps
- **Milestone 4:** Final integration and deployment - Pending

## Collaboration and Communication
- **Meetings and Discussions:** No formal meetings during this session; most work was conducted independently.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to prioritize schema refinement before proceeding with additional feature development.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Victor to finalize the schema and begin implementation.
  - Team members to review and provide feedback on the updated schema by [specific date].

---

## Risk Management
- **Risk:** Potential performance issues during data migration to the new schema.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement thorough testing in a staging environment before full deployment.

---

## Retrospective
- **What Went Well:** Successfully refined the database schema with a focus on scalability and security, positioning the project for future growth.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Better planning for data migration strategies should be incorporated earlier in the design phase.
- **Actionable Insights:** Regular schema reviews and updates should be scheduled as part of the development cycle to ensure the database evolves with the project.
