## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - To integrate a custom user registration plugin into a WordPress site hosted on Hostinger, enhancing it with features like user listing, custom redirects, multi-step forms, and social connect functionality.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Developed a custom WordPress plugin from scratch, including functionalities for registration, user management, and social logins.
  - Set up the plugin environment via FTP and adjusted directory permissions to resolve access issues.
  - Implemented advanced features within the plugin, such as email confirmations and admin approval processes.
  - Tested the plugin on a staging environment to ensure compatibility and functionality.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - Encountered permission issues with the `wp-content` folder, resolved by adjusting file permissions via FTP.
  - Successfully integrated social login capabilities using HybridAuth, enhancing the user experience.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The custom plugin significantly improved the registration process, offering a more tailored and secure user experience. It also streamlined the admin's ability to manage and approve new users.

## Code Snippets and Context

```php
// Sample function for admin approval process
function approve_new_user($user_id) {
    update_user_meta($user_id, 'is_approved', 'false');
    // Add logic to send notification to admin
}

add_action('user_register', 'approve_new_user');
```
