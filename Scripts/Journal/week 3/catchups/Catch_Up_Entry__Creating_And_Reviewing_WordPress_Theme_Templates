    </header><!-- .entry-header -->

    <div class="entry-content">
        <?php
        the_content();

        wp_link_pages(array(
            'before' => '<div class="page-links">' . __('Pages:', 'your-text-domain'),
            'after'  => '</div>',
        ));
        ?>
    </div><!-- .entry-content -->

    <?php if (get_edit_post_link()) : ?>
        <footer class="entry-footer">
            <?php
            edit_post_link(
                sprintf(
                    __('Edit<span class="screen-reader-text"> "%s"</span>', 'your-text-domain'),
                    get_the_title()
                ),
                '<span class="edit-link">',
                '</span>'
            );
            ?>
        </footer><!-- .entry-footer -->
    <?php endif; ?>
</article><!-- #post-<?php the_ID(); ?> -->
```

<footer role="contentinfo">
    <p>&copy; <?php echo date('Y'); ?> <a href="<?php echo esc_url(home_url('/')); ?>"><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></a>. All rights reserved.</p>
    <nav aria-label="Footer Navigation">
        <?php
        wp_nav_menu(array(
            'theme_location' => 'footer',
            'container'      => false,
            'menu_class'     => 'footer-menu',
            'depth'          => 1,
            'fallback_cb'    => false,
            'link_before'    => '<span>',
