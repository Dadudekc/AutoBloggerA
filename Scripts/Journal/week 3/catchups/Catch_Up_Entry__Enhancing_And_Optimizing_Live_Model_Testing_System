# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_And_Optimizing_Live_Model_Testing_System**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - The primary objective was to improve and optimize the existing code for live testing machine learning models on real-time stock data.
  - The goal was to make the system more efficient, scalable, and capable of handling multiple symbols and models simultaneously.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reviewed the initial code and identified areas for improvement, including handling multiple stock symbols, adding support for multiple models, and enhancing the user interface.
  - Reworked the `FinnhubWebSocket` class to support multiple stock symbols and model predictions for each symbol.
  - Enhanced the GUI to allow users to add different models for different stock symbols, providing flexibility in testing various models.
  - Improved error handling and modularity, making the system more robust and easier to maintain.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - The main challenge was designing a system that could efficiently handle multiple stock symbols and their corresponding models without overcomplicating the code structure.
  - A breakthrough was achieved by using dictionaries to manage the data and models for each symbol, which simplified the process and improved the system’s scalability.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The system now supports multiple symbols and models, making it more versatile for live testing.
  - The user interface is more user-friendly, allowing for easier management of symbols and models.
  - The improvements will significantly enhance the project's ability to test and refine models in a live environment, leading to better performance in real-world applications.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting, data manipulation, and integrating machine learning models.
- **WebSocket Communication:** Used to fetch real-time data from the Finnhub API.
- **Dash and Plotly:** Applied to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing live data and model predictions.
- **Joblib:** Employed to load and manage machine learning models.
- **Tkinter:** Used to create a graphical user interface for managing the system’s configurations.

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Gained deeper insight into handling multiple data streams and models in a real-time environment.
  - Improved understanding of how to structure code for scalability and maintainability in complex systems.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Managing the concurrency between the WebSocket data stream and the Dash server posed some challenges, which were addressed by leveraging threading effectively.

- **Future Application:**
  - The techniques learned in handling multiple models and symbols will be applied in future projects where scalability and real-time data processing are critical.
  - The error handling strategies implemented will be refined and used as a standard in similar projects to ensure robustness.

---

## To-Do
- **Test Multi-Symbol Support:** Thoroughly test the system’s ability to handle multiple stock symbols and models simultaneously to ensure stability.
- **Refactor Code for Readability:** Although the system is functional, further refactoring can be done to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Implement Asynchronous I/O:** Explore the possibility of using asynchronous I/O to further enhance the performance of the WebSocket data handling.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Multi-Symbol Support in FinnhubWebSocket

```python
class FinnhubWebSocket:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, symbols: list, interval: str, models=None):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.symbols = symbols
        self.interval = pd.to_timedelta(interval)
        self.ws_url = f"wss://ws.finnhub.io?token={self.api_key}"
        self.chart_data = {symbol: {'timestamp': [], 'open': [], 'high': [], 'low': [], 'close': [], 'prediction': []} for symbol in symbols}
        self.current_candle = {symbol: {'open': None, 'high': None, 'low': None, 'close': None} for symbol in symbols}
        self.last_candle_close_time = {symbol: None for symbol in symbols}
        self.models = models if models else {}
```

### Enhanced GUI for Managing Symbols and Models

```python
class TradingRobotPlugApp(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        super().__init__()
        self.title("TradingRobotPlug Dashboard")
        self.geometry("800x600")
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.symbols = tk.StringVar(value="AAPL,TSLA")
        self.interval = tk.StringVar(value="1min")
        self.model_paths = {}
        self.create_deployment_tab()
```
