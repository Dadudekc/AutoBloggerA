# Catch_Up_Entry__Integrating_Flask_with_WordPress__and_Enhancing_Data_Security

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Integrate Flask with WordPress to streamline financial data management and user interaction.
  - Implement a secure method for managing sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials.
  - Update and adapt a Tkinter-based GUI script for use in a Flask application that interacts with WordPress.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Explored Flask's integration with WordPress, enabling the backend to handle data processing while WordPress manages the frontend.
  - Utilized environment variables and `.env` files to securely manage API keys, ensuring they are not hardcoded in the application.
  - Converted an existing Python script designed for a desktop application (Tkinter) into a Flask-based web service, making it accessible via WordPress.
  - Adjusted configuration files (`config.yaml`, `config.ini`, and `.env`) to align with secure practices and correct API endpoints.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenges:**
    - Ensuring seamless communication between Flask and WordPress without compromising on security or performance.
    - Handling the complexities of integrating Flask’s backend capabilities with WordPress’s frontend features.
  - **Breakthroughs:**
    - Successfully managed to integrate Flask with WordPress, enabling a unified platform where WordPress serves as the user interface while Flask handles data processing.
    - Implemented a secure method for managing sensitive data, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The integration of Flask with WordPress has provided a powerful and flexible platform for financial data management. Users can now interact with the system through WordPress, with data processing handled efficiently by Flask.
  - Sensitive data is now managed securely, enhancing the overall security posture of the application.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Utilized for creating the backend API that interacts with WordPress and handles data processing.
- **WordPress:** Leveraged as the frontend for user interaction, integrating seamlessly with Flask for backend tasks.
- **Environment Management:** Implemented `.env` files to manage sensitive data securely.
- **API Integration:** Integrated Alpha Vantage and other financial APIs with Flask, ensuring secure API key management.
- **Database Management:** Ensured that data fetching checks the database first, minimizing redundant API calls and improving efficiency.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Flask API for Data Fetching

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/fetch-data', methods=['POST'])
def fetch_data():
    api_key = os.getenv('ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY')
    symbol = request.json.get('symbol')
    start_date = request.json.get('start_date')
    end_date = request.json.get('end_date')
    
    data = fetch_data_logic(api_key, symbol, start_date, end_date)
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Environment Variables

```ini
# .env file
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=C6AG9NZX6QIPYTX4
POLYGONIO_API_KEY=ruqNOBWgLAXuiUM0ugL5WmxbkIdlELp4
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/trading_data
```

### Configuration File

```yaml
# config.yaml
API:
  base_url: 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query'
  timeout: 30

DATABASE:
  db_name: 'trading_data'
  db_user: 'root'
```
