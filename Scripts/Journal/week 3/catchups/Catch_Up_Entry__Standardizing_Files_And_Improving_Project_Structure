## Code Snippets and Context

### Example of Improved Python Script

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlugWeb\Scripts\DataFetchers\alphavantagefetcher.py
# This script fetches data from Alpha Vantage API and processes it.

import os
import sys
import requests

# Add project root to the Python path
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(script_dir, os.pardir, os.pardir))
sys.path.append(project_root)

def fetch_data(api_key, symbol):
    """Fetches data from Alpha Vantage API for the given stock symbol."""
    url = f"https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={symbol}&apikey={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return data
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch data: {response.status_code}")

# Further processing functions here
```

### Example of Improved PHP Script

```php
<?php
// C:\TheTradingRobotPlugWeb\my-custom-theme\class-thetradingrobotplugin.php
// Main plugin file for initializing the Trading Robot Plugin.

if (!defined('WPINC')) {
    die;
}

class TheTradingRobotPlugPlugin {

    public function __construct() {
        // Initialize the plugin
        $this->define_constants();
        $this->load_dependencies();
        $this->initialize_hooks();
    }

    private function define_constants() {
        define('TRADINGROBOTPLUGIN_VERSION', '1.0.0');
        define('TRADINGROBOTPLUGIN_PATH', plugin_dir_path(__FILE__));
        define('TRADINGROBOTPLUGIN_URL', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__));
    }

    private function load_dependencies() {
        require_once TRADINGROBOTPLUGIN_PATH . 'includes/class-thetradingrobotplugin-admin.php';
        // Other dependencies here
    }

    private function initialize_hooks() {
        add_action('admin_menu', array($this, 'add_plugin_menu'));
    }

    public function add_plugin_menu() {
        add_options_page(
            'Trading Robot Plugin Settings',
            'Trading Robot Plug',
            'manage_options',
            'tradingrobotplugin',
            array($this, 'display_plugin_settings_page')
        );
    }

    public function display_plugin_settings_page() {
        require_once TRADINGROBOTPLUGIN_PATH . 'includes/admin/settings-page.php';
    }

    public function run() {
        // Run the plugin logic
    }
}
```
