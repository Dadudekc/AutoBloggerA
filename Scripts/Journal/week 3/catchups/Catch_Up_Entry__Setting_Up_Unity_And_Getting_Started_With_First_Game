# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Setting_Up_Unity_And_Getting_Started_With_First_Game**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Successfully install Unity Hub and sign in to begin working on the first game development project, which blends elements from "Overcooked," "Diner Dash," and a bartender game into one cohesive multiplayer experience.
  - Understand how to start a new project in Unity and get familiar with the basic Unity interface and workflow.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Installed Unity Hub on a Linux system by following the appropriate commands and steps.
  - Signed in to Unity Hub and prepared to create a new project.
  - Received guidance on choosing the right Unity template (2D or 3D) based on the game concept.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - The installation process was mostly smooth, with a minor issue regarding the `chrome-sandbox` file, which was identified as non-impactful.
  - Gained clarity on the decision between using a 2D or 3D template for the game, with a recommendation to start with a 3D template for better flexibility in gameplay dynamics.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - Unity Hub is successfully installed and operational, setting the stage for the development of the first-ever game project.
  - A solid understanding of the next steps required to start creating the game, including creating a new project, familiarizing with the Unity interface, and choosing the right template for the game.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Unity Hub Installation:** Successfully installed and set up Unity Hub on a Linux system.
- **Game Development Basics:** Acquired basic knowledge about starting a game project in Unity, including template selection and interface navigation.
- **Decision-Making:** Evaluated the pros and cons of using a 2D vs. 3D template for the project, ultimately leaning towards a 3D approach.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Learned how to install and set up Unity Hub on a Linux system.
  - Gained a basic understanding of Unity’s interface and the importance of selecting the right project template based on game design goals.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered a minor issue with the `chrome-sandbox` during installation, which was not impactful but highlighted the need to monitor installation logs carefully.

- **Future Application:**
  - Moving forward, will apply the knowledge gained in Unity’s interface and template selection to build the game efficiently.
  - Will continue to follow structured guidance to ensure that the project is built on a solid foundation.

## To-Do
- **Create New Project:** Start a new project in Unity using the 3D template, naming the project "Nightshift."
- **Familiarize with Unity Interface:** Spend time exploring the Unity interface, focusing on key panels like the Scene View, Game View, Hierarchy, Project Window, and Inspector.
- **Begin Basic Game Setup:** Add basic game objects and experiment with movement, camera angles, and lighting to get a feel for building the game environment.
- **Follow Tutorials:** Engage with beginner Unity tutorials to reinforce learning and practice the basics of game development.
- **Set Up Version Control:** Consider setting up Git for version control to track changes and collaborate more effectively in the future.
