# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_Changes_in_Project_Files_and_Creating_Commit_Message**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Address the changes made to various project files and generate a detailed commit message summarizing these changes.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Reviewed the output from `git status` to identify modified, deleted, and untracked files in the project.
  - Generated a comprehensive commit message that reflects the current state of the project files, summarizing the modifications, deletions, and additions.
  - Ensured the commit message accurately represents the changes made to the GUI scripts, model training scripts, PowerShell scripts, and project configuration files.
  - Highlighted the addition of new journal entries documenting project progress and the removal of outdated models and results.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - Challenge: Ensuring that the commit message was both concise and detailed enough to capture all the changes.
  - Breakthrough: Successfully created a structured and informative commit message that provides a clear overview of the modifications, which will aid in future project tracking.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The creation of a well-organized commit message contributes to better version control and project documentation. It also facilitates easier tracking of changes, making it simpler to review the project history and understand the context of each modification.
