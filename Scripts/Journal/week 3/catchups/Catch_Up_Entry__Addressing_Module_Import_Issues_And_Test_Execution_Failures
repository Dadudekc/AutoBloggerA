# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Addressing_Module_Import_Issues_And_Test_Execution_Failures**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Resolve module import errors and successfully execute unit tests for the `DataFetcher` module.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Identified and corrected module import paths to match the project structure.
  - Adjusted the test script to ensure correct importing of the `DataFetcher` module.
  - Ran multiple tests (`test_data_fetcher.py`, `test_polygon_fetcher.py`, etc.) to verify the correct functionality of the code.
  
- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenges:** Encountered repeated `ModuleNotFoundError` issues when attempting to import the `data_fetcher` module.
  - **Breakthroughs:** Realized that the import paths were incorrect due to mismatches between actual directory names and the import statements. Corrected the import paths, which resolved the errors.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - Successfully executed the `test_data_fetcher.py` script after resolving import issues. This allowed for validation of the `DataFetcher` module’s functionality.
  - Identified further issues with test failures related to data processing logic, particularly in handling expected versus actual data formats.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Applied skills in Python to troubleshoot and correct import errors, ensuring the proper structure and execution of test scripts.
- **Unit Testing:** Employed unit testing to validate code correctness and functionality across various modules.
- **Error Handling:** Improved error handling in the test scripts to capture and address issues related to data processing and API integration.
- **Path Management:** Utilized Python's `sys.path` to dynamically adjust import paths based on project structure.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Importance of verifying file paths and import statements, especially in complex projects with multiple modules and directories.
  - Realized the need for consistent naming conventions across directories to avoid import errors.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered discrepancies in expected data formats during test execution, leading to failed assertions. Addressed by improving the understanding of the data pipeline and refining test cases.

- **Future Application:**
  - Ensure that all project directories follow a consistent naming convention and that import statements are regularly validated when new modules are added.
  - Refine unit tests to include more detailed checks for data format validation, ensuring that data processing logic is thoroughly tested.

---

## To-Do

- **Fix Test Failures:** Investigate and resolve the test failure in `test_polygon_fetcher.py` related to the empty DataFrame issue.
- **Review Data Processing Logic:** Revisit the `DataFetcher` module’s data processing logic to ensure compatibility with all expected data formats.
- **Complete Unit Tests:** Finalize the remaining unit tests for other data fetcher modules by [specific date].
- **Enhance Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling in the `DataFetcher` module to gracefully handle unexpected data formats or API errors.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Test Case for Data Fetching

```python
# Test for the fetch_data method in DataFetcher

@patch('Scripts.Data_Fetchers.data_fetcher.DataFetcher._async_fetch_data', new_callable=AsyncMock)
@patch('Scripts.Data_Fetchers.data_fetcher.DataFetcher.process_data', autospec=True)
@patch('Scripts.Data_Fetchers.data_fetcher.DataFetcher.store_data', autospec=True)
def test_fetch_data(self, mock_store_data, mock_process_data, mock_async_fetch_data):
    # Mock the async fetch data to return a sample dictionary
    mock_async_fetch_data.return_value = {"Time Series (Daily)": {"2024-01-01": {"close": 150}}}
    mock_process_data.return_value = pd.DataFrame({"close": [150]})

    # Test the fetch_data method
    asyncio.run(self.fetcher.fetch_data(['AAPL'], 'daily'))

    # Verify that process_data and store_data were called
    mock_process_data.assert_called_once()
    mock_store_data.assert_called_once_with(self.fetcher, mock_process_data.return_value, 'AAPL')
```

### Test Case for Polygon Fetcher

```python
# Test for fetching data for a single symbol in PolygonDataFetcher

@patch('Scripts.Data_Fetchers.polygon_fetcher.PolygonDataFetcher.fetch_data', new_callable=AsyncMock)
def test_fetch_data_for_symbol(self, mock_fetch_data):
    # Test fetching data for a single symbol
    symbol = "AAPL"
    start_date = "2023-01-01"
    end_date = "2023-12-31"
    mock_fetch_data.return_value = {
        'results': [
            {'t': 1672531199000, 'o': 150, 'h': 155, 'l': 149, 'c': 152, 'v': 1000000}
        ]
    }

    # Run the async fetch_data_for_symbol method
    result_df = asyncio.run(self.fetcher.fetch_data_for_symbol(symbol, start_date, end_date))

    # Check if the DataFrame was created correctly
    self.assertIsInstance(result_df, pd.DataFrame)
    self.assertFalse(result_df.empty)
    self.assertEqual(result_df.iloc[0]['open'], 150)
```
