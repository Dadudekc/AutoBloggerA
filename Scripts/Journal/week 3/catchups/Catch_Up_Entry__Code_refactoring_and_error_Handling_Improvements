# Catch_Up_Entry__Code_Refactoring_and_Error_Handling_Improvements

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Refactor code for better compatibility across Linux and Windows environments.
  - Address permission errors encountered during script execution.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Updated file paths and directory creation logic in the `momentum_indicators.py` script to use `Path` objects for improved cross-platform compatibility.
  - Addressed permission errors by adjusting directory paths to user-accessible locations within the project structure.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - Encountered permission errors when trying to create directories in restricted locations.
  - Solved this by adjusting paths to use relative project paths, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and user accessibility.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The updated scripts now run without errors on both Linux and Windows, improving the robustness and portability of the project. This allows for seamless development and testing across different environments.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Enhanced code for cross-platform compatibility and error handling.
- **Pathlib Module:** Utilized `Pathlib` for managing file paths and directories, ensuring that paths are correctly handled across different operating systems.
- **Logging:** Employed logging to track script execution and identify potential issues during runtime.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained deeper understanding of how file paths and permissions can differ between operating systems, and how to handle these differences programmatically.
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered unexpected permission errors that required adjusting the directory paths in the code.
- **Future Application:** 
  - Will continue to use `Pathlib` and relative paths to ensure code is portable and functions correctly on different systems.

---

## To-Do

- **Continue Refactoring:** Review and refactor remaining scripts to ensure they are cross-platform compatible.
- **Testing:** Conduct further testing on different systems to verify that all scripts run smoothly.
- **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to reflect changes made to the code, particularly in handling file paths and permissions.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Updated Momentum Indicators Script

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
import pandas as pd

# Add project root to the Python path
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parent.parent.parent.parent
sys.path.append(str(project_root))

# Set up relative paths for data and logs
data_path = project_root / 'data'
log_path = project_root / 'logs'

# Ensure the directories exist
data_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
log_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** The importance of using platform-independent code became evident, and this practice will be prioritized in future development.
- **Reflection:** The refactoring process reinforced the need for thorough testing on multiple platforms to ensure code robustness and portability.

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** No formal meetings were held during this session.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to standardize file paths across all scripts for better cross-platform compatibility.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Continue testing refactored code on different operating systems to ensure compatibility.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Compatibility issues may arise when scripts are run on different operating systems.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Refactor code to use platform-independent paths and thoroughly test on multiple systems.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** Successfully resolved permission issues by adjusting file paths to user-accessible locations.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Testing across different systems should be more thorough and included earlier in the development process.
- **Actionable Insights:** Standardize the use of platform-independent paths across all scripts to prevent similar issues in the future.
