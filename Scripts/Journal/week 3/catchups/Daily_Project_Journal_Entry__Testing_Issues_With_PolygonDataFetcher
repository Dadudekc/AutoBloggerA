## Session Prompt
**Prompt:** 
"Use this conversation to make a project journal entry following the standards and guides of the template below. Base the title of the entry off of the conversation."

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Diagnose and address the issues with `PolygonDataFetcher` unit tests that were failing during execution.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Reviewed test failures in the `test_polygon_fetcher.py` file.
  - Identified problems with date formatting in the `test_extract_results` test case.
  - Investigated the `fetch_data_for_symbol` method to determine why the DataFrame returned was empty.
  - Added debugging logs to better understand API responses and data extraction.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenge:** The primary issue was with mismatched date formats in test cases and an empty DataFrame return.
  - **Breakthrough:** By adding detailed debugging logs, I was able to trace and confirm that the API responses were correctly formatted, which pinpointed issues in data extraction and date filtering.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - Improved the `extract_results` method to match the expected date format and adjusted the `fetch_data_for_symbol` method to handle empty DataFrames more effectively.
  - These changes are expected to ensure that the unit tests pass successfully and improve the reliability of the data fetching and processing methods.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Unit Testing:** Applied unit testing principles to diagnose and fix issues in the `PolygonDataFetcher` class.
- **Debugging:** Utilized debugging techniques to track and resolve issues with data processing and API interactions.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Worked with asynchronous functions and mock objects to simulate and test API data fetching.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Understanding the importance of aligning test cases with the actual data format used in the application.
  - Gained insight into effective debugging practices for asynchronous data fetching and processing.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered issues with empty DataFrames and mismatched date formats, which were resolved through targeted debugging and method adjustments.

- **Future Application:** 
  - Apply the debugging insights and methods to other parts of the project where similar data processing and testing issues might arise.

---

## To-Do

- **Test Adjustments:** Finalize the adjustments to the `extract_results` method and re-run tests to ensure they pass.
- **Documentation:** Update the documentation for `PolygonDataFetcher` to reflect changes made during debugging.
- **Additional Testing:** Conduct additional tests for other symbols and date ranges to verify robustness of the data fetching methods.

## Code Snippets

**Example Adjusted `extract_results` Method:**
```python
def extract_results(self, data):
    results = []
    for entry in data.get('results', []):
        result = {
            'date': pd.to_datetime(entry['t'], unit='ms').date().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            'open': entry['o'],
            'high': entry['h'],
            'low': entry['l'],
            'close': entry['c'],
            'volume': entry['v']
        }
        results.append(result)
    return results
```

**Example Debugging Log Addition:**
```python
async def fetch_data(self, url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        data = await response.json()
        self.utils.debug(f"API response data: {data}")  # Debug log
        return data
```
