# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Unit_Testing_And_Validation_Of_PolygonDataFetcher_Class**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The goal of this session was to create a comprehensive test script for the `PolygonDataFetcher` class to ensure the robustness and reliability of the data fetching and processing logic.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Developed a pytest-based test suite with asynchronous support for testing key functionalities of the `PolygonDataFetcher` class.
  - Mocked external dependencies, such as API responses and the `ClientSession` from `aiohttp`, to simulate different scenarios without making real API calls.
  - Wrote individual test cases to verify the construction of API URLs, data fetching, and data extraction logic.
  - Executed the test suite to ensure the code performs as expected under various conditions.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - A key challenge was handling the asynchronous nature of the `PolygonDataFetcher` methods. This was addressed by using `pytest-asyncio` to effectively manage async tests.
  - A significant breakthrough was successfully mocking the `aiohttp.ClientSession` methods, allowing for thorough testing without relying on external API calls.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The test suite covers critical aspects of the `PolygonDataFetcher` class, improving confidence in its reliability and stability.
  - These tests help ensure that the data fetching process works as intended and can handle various edge cases, which is crucial for the project's data integrity.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for writing the test suite and managing asynchronous code.
- **Asyncio and Aiohttp:** Employed for handling asynchronous HTTP requests and managing event loops.
- **Pytest and Pytest-Asyncio:** Used for creating and running test cases, especially those involving asynchronous code.
- **Unit Testing:** Applied unit testing principles to verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.
- **Mocking with Unittest.Mock:** Leveraged to simulate API responses and external dependencies, enabling isolated and repeatable tests.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained deeper insights into testing asynchronous Python code, particularly when dealing with external API calls.
  - Learned how to effectively mock dependencies in unit tests to create isolated testing environments.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Mocking asynchronous methods required a slightly different approach than synchronous methods, which was initially a challenge but was resolved through research and practice.

- **Future Application:** 
  - The techniques learned for mocking asynchronous methods will be invaluable in future projects involving async code, particularly in areas like API integrations and real-time data processing.

## To-Do

- **Complete Edge Case Tests:** Develop additional test cases to cover edge scenarios, such as invalid API responses and network failures.
- **Refactor for Maintainability:** Review the `PolygonDataFetcher` class for any potential improvements in code maintainability and readability.
- **Document Test Cases:** Update project documentation to include details of the test suite and instructions for running the tests.
- **Integrate Tests into CI/CD Pipeline:** Ensure that these tests are integrated into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Test for API URL Construction

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_construct_api_url(polygon_data_fetcher):
    symbol = "AAPL"
    start_date = "2021-01-01"
    end_date = "2021-12-31"
    expected_url = f"https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker/{symbol}/range/1/day/{start_date}/{end_date}?apiKey={polygon_data_fetcher.api_key}"
    
    url = polygon_data_fetcher.construct_api_url(symbol, start_date, end_date)
    assert url == expected_url
```

### Mocked Async Data Fetch Test

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_fetch_data(polygon_data_fetcher):
    url = "https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker/AAPL/range/1/day/2021-01-01/2021-12-31?apiKey=test_key"

    mock_response = {
        "results": [
            {
                "t": 1612156800000,
                "o": 100,
                "h": 110,
                "l": 90,
                "c": 105,
                "v": 1500
            }
        ]
    }

    with patch('aiohttp.ClientSession.get', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_get:
        mock_get.return_value.__aenter__.return_value.json = AsyncMock(return_value=mock_response)
        mock_get.return_value.__aenter__.return_value.raise_for_status = AsyncMock()

        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            data = await polygon_data_fetcher.fetch_data(url, session)
            assert data == mock_response
```
