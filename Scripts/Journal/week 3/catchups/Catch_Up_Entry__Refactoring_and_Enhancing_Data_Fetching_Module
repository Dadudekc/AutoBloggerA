# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Refactoring_and_Enhancing_Data_Fetching_Module**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Refactor and enhance the data fetching module, specifically focusing on the scripts that fetch data from Alpha Vantage and Polygon APIs.
  - Improve the structure, error handling, and logging within the data fetching scripts.
  - Document the module comprehensively and update the project journal.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reviewed and refactored `polygon_fetcher.py` and `real_time_fetcher.py` to improve API interaction and error handling.
  - Deleted obsolete scripts: `fetch_data.py`, `process_data.py`, and related backup files.
  - Cleaned up `test_pandas.py` by removing unnecessary test files.
  - Documented the data fetching module, creating a detailed outline of its structure, accomplishments, challenges, and future directions.
  - Updated journal entries with recent notes on documentation and model training enhancements.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - No major challenges were encountered during the refactoring process.
  - A significant breakthrough was realizing the redundancy in code and refactoring it for better maintainability and readability.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The refactored data fetching module now has improved error handling, logging, and structure, making it more robust and easier to maintain.
  - The deletion of obsolete scripts reduced clutter and potential confusion in the project directory.
  - Comprehensive documentation of the data fetching module will aid future developers and maintainers in understanding and extending the module.

```python
# Example: Refactored method to construct API URL in `polygon_fetcher.py`
def construct_api_url(self, symbol: str, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> str:
    return f"{self.base_url}/{symbol}/range/1/day/{start_date}/{end_date}?apiKey={self.api_key}"
```

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used for scripting, data manipulation, and API integration.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leveraged asyncio and aiohttp for non-blocking API calls.
- **Logging:** Implemented comprehensive logging for better debugging and progress tracking.
- **Version Control (Git):** Utilized for tracking changes, managing branches, and collaborating effectively.
- **Data Analysis:** Applied data analysis techniques to process and validate the fetched data.
- **API Integration:** Integrated third-party APIs (Alpha Vantage and Polygon) for data retrieval.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Improved understanding of asynchronous programming and its benefits in API integration.
  - Recognized the importance of reducing code redundancy for better maintainability.
  - Gained insights into effective error handling and logging practices.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered minor challenges in consolidating redundant code, which were resolved through careful refactoring.

- **Future Application:**
  - Apply similar refactoring techniques to other modules in the project to enhance maintainability.
  - Continue to implement comprehensive logging and error handling across all scripts.

---

## To-Do

- **Complete Unit Tests:** Finalize the remaining unit tests for the refactored data fetching scripts.
- **Refactor Code:** Continue improving the structure and readability of other modules in the project.
- **Documentation:** Keep updating project documentation to reflect recent changes and improvements.
- **Code Review:** Schedule a code review session to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Feature Implementation:** Begin working on caching mechanisms to optimize API response times.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Data Fetch Script (Refactored Example)

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Scripts\Data_Fetchers\polygon_fetcher.py

import os
import sys
import pandas as pd
import aiohttp
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
from aiohttp import ClientSession, ClientTimeout
import asyncio
import logging
from pathlib import Path

# Ensure the project root is in the Python path for module imports
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parent.parent
sys.path.append(str(project_root))

from Scripts.Utilities.DataLakeHandler import DataLakeHandler
from Scripts.Data_Fetchers.base_fetcher import DataFetcher

class PolygonDataFetcher(DataFetcher):
    def __init__(self, data_lake_handler: Optional[DataLakeHandler] = None):
        super().__init__('POLYGON_API_KEY', 'https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker',
                         'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data/polygon',
                         'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data/processed_polygon',
                         'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data/trading_data.db',
                         'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/logs/polygon.log',
                         'Polygon', data_lake_handler)
        self.utils = self._initialize_utils()

    def _initialize_utils(self):
        return None

    def construct_api_url(self, symbol: str, start_date: str, end_date: str) -> str:
        return f"{self.base_url}/{symbol}/range/1/day/{start_date}/{end_date}?apiKey={self.api_key}"

    async def fetch_data(self, url: str, session: ClientSession, retries: int = 3) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        for attempt in range(retries):
            try:
                async with session.get(url) as response:
                    response.raise_for_status()
                    data = await response.json()
                    return data
            except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:
                if attempt < retries - 1 and e.status in {429, 500, 502, 503, 504}:
                    await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
                else:
                    self.utils.logger.error(f"Error fetching data from {url}: {e}")
                    raise
            except Exception as e:
                self.utils.logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
                raise
```
