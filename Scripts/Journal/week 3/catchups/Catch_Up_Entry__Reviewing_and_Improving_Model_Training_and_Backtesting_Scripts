# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Reviewing_and_Improving_Model_Training_and_Backtesting_Scripts**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The main objective of this session was to review and refine several key scripts related to model training and backtesting within the project. The goal was to identify areas of improvement, streamline processes, and ensure that the scripts are robust and maintainable.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - **Reviewed `backtest.py`:** Evaluated the script’s structure and identified enhancements, such as improving the `TradingEnv` class, handling transaction costs better, and refining the backtesting logic.
  - **Analyzed `model_training_main.py`:** Assessed the main model training script, focusing on modularity, error handling, and code structure. Recommendations were made to refactor the code for better scalability and maintainability.
  - **Evaluated `advanced_lstm_model_trainer.py`:** Reviewed the script for training advanced LSTM models, noting the strengths in data preprocessing and hyperparameter optimization while suggesting improvements in path management, error handling, and documentation.
  - **Reviewed `arima_model_trainer.py`:** Analyzed the ARIMA model training script, identifying key strengths in logging, background processing, and error handling. Areas for improvement include optimizing ARIMA parameters, enhancing thread management, and expanding evaluation metrics.
  - **Evaluated LSTM model training script:** Conducted a detailed review, identifying the need for better flexibility, improved NaN handling, and enhanced cross-validation processes.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenges:** 
    - Managing the complexity of multiple scripts with different purposes and ensuring consistency across them was challenging.
    - Ensuring that each script’s refactoring suggestions were practical and wouldn’t disrupt existing functionality was also a significant challenge.
  - **Breakthroughs:** 
    - A key breakthrough was recognizing the potential of increasing modularity and configuration flexibility, which would lead to a more maintainable and scalable project structure.
    - Identifying the need for improved logging and error handling across scripts to enhance debugging and project transparency.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The reviews and suggested improvements are expected to significantly enhance the quality, maintainability, and scalability of the project’s model training and backtesting components. By addressing issues such as path management, error handling, and code modularity, the project will be better positioned to handle future growth and complexity.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used extensively for reviewing and suggesting improvements to the scripts, focusing on best practices for code structure and error handling.
- **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras):** Applied knowledge of LSTM models and neural network training processes to review and refine the related scripts.
- **Statistical Modeling (ARIMA):** Leveraged understanding of ARIMA models to assess the script’s approach to time series forecasting.
- **Project Management:** Utilized project management principles to track the progress of the review and ensure that all scripts were thoroughly assessed.
- **Version Control (Git):** Ensured that all changes and suggestions were tracked for future implementation.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - The session highlighted the importance of modularity and flexibility in large projects. By structuring code into smaller, independent modules, it becomes easier to manage and extend.
  - The need for comprehensive error handling was reinforced, especially in scripts that deal with complex processes like model training and backtesting.
  - The value of detailed documentation was underscored, particularly in ensuring that other developers (or future versions of oneself) can understand and build upon the work.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Managing cross-script dependencies without causing disruptions was more challenging than anticipated. Ensuring that changes in one script didn’t inadvertently affect others required careful consideration.

- **Future Application:** 
  - These lessons will influence future work by encouraging a more modular approach to script development and a greater emphasis on error handling and documentation. This will be crucial as the project scales and more features are added.

## To-Do

- **Refactor Scripts for Modularity:** Break down large scripts into smaller, reusable modules to improve maintainability.
- **Implement Error Handling Improvements:** Enhance error handling across all reviewed scripts to ensure robust operation in various scenarios.
- **Add Detailed Documentation:** Develop comprehensive docstrings and inline comments for all scripts to improve readability and ease of future maintenance.
- **Optimize ARIMA Model Parameters:** Implement automated parameter selection for ARIMA models to enhance model accuracy.
- **Enhance Logging:** Upgrade logging configurations to support different levels of logging (INFO, DEBUG) and ensure that logs are informative and actionable.

## Code Snippets and Context

### `backtest.py`

```python
# Example snippet from backtest.py to improve transaction cost handling
def _take_action(self, action):
    action_type = action[0]
    amount = action[1]
    
    if action_type == 0:  # Buy
        total_possible = self.balance // self.price
        shares_bought = total_possible * amount
        cost = shares_bought * self.price * (1 + self.transaction_cost)  # Include transaction cost
        self.balance -= cost
        self.shares_held += shares_bought
    elif action_type == 1:  # Sell
        shares_sold = self.shares_held * amount
        self.balance += shares_sold * self.price * (1 - self.transaction_cost)  # Include transaction cost
        self.shares_held -= shares_sold
```

### `arima_model_trainer.py`

```python
# Example of improved logging in arima_model_trainer.py
def background_training(self):
    self.display_message("Starting ARIMA training background process...", "INFO")
    results = {'predictions': [], 'errors': [], 'parameters': {}, 'performance_metrics': {}}

    # Improved logging for debugging
    self.display_message(f"Train size: {train_size}, Test size: {len(test)}", "INFO")
    self.display_message(f"Train data: {train.head()}", "DEBUG")
    self.display_message(f"Test data: {test.head()}", "DEBUG")
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** Consider implementing a configuration management system that allows for dynamic adjustment of paths, parameters, and logging levels across all scripts.
- **Reflection:** The review process emphasized the importance of maintaining consistency across scripts in a large project. Regular reviews like this should be scheduled to ensure that all components align with the overall project goals and standards.
- **Feedback:** Positive feedback from self-reflection on the benefits of increased modularity and better error handling across the project.
