# Catch_Up_Entry__Addressing_ModuleNotFoundError_And_Debugging_Data_Handling_Pipeline

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` related to the `DataStore` module.
  - Debug and ensure the `DataHandler` pipeline processes data correctly, including data loading, preprocessing, saving, and visualization.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Attempted to run the `DataHandler.py` and `automatedatapipeline.py` scripts multiple times to troubleshoot the `ModuleNotFoundError` and `AttributeError` issues.
  - Modified the import paths to include the project root dynamically, ensuring the correct module paths were included.
  - Debugged the `automatedatapipeline.py` script to fix the issue with the mismatched dimensions in data visualization.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - Encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `DataStore` module, which required ensuring the module's correct location and updating the import paths.
  - Resolved the `AttributeError` by confirming that the data was correctly handled as pandas DataFrames rather than numpy arrays, ensuring `.to_csv()` could be used.
  - Identified a dimension mismatch in the `automatedatapipeline.py` script during data visualization, which was resolved by aligning the dimensions of the data used in plotting.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - Successfully ran the `DataHandler` pipeline, loading, preprocessing, saving, and visualizing data without errors. This confirmed the integrity and functionality of the data handling process.
  - Ensured that the `automatedatapipeline.py` script correctly processes and visualizes the data, leading to better insights and preparation for advanced financial analysis.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** 
  - Utilized for scripting, debugging, and data manipulation.
- **Data Handling and Preprocessing:** 
  - Managed data using pandas for loading, preprocessing, and saving processed data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** 
  - Employed for data visualization, specifically in plotting moving averages.
- **Error Handling and Debugging:** 
  - Focused on resolving `ModuleNotFoundError` and `AttributeError` issues, ensuring smooth script execution.

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Improved understanding of Python's import system and the importance of correctly setting the Python path.
  - Gained experience in troubleshooting and resolving common data handling errors, particularly with mismatched data dimensions during visualization.
  - Recognized the importance of ensuring data is consistently handled as the correct object type, such as pandas DataFrames, to avoid errors in later processing steps.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - The `ModuleNotFoundError` was unexpected, requiring a review of the module structure and path settings.
  - The dimension mismatch in the visualization was also unforeseen, leading to additional debugging steps.

- **Future Application:**
  - Apply the improved understanding of Python's import mechanics in future modules to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` issues.
  - Ensure careful data preprocessing to prevent dimension mismatches in visualization, which can disrupt analysis workflows.

## To-Do

- **Review and Refactor Code:**
  - Refactor the `DataHandler` and `automatedatapipeline.py` scripts for better readability and maintainability.
- **Expand Unit Testing:**
  - Develop and run additional unit tests for the data handling and processing scripts to ensure robustness.
- **Implement Caching:**
  - Consider implementing a caching mechanism for API calls in future iterations to optimize data fetching.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Dynamic Python Path Adjustment

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Adjust the Python path dynamically
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parents[1]  # Adjust to point to 'C:\TheTradingRobotPlugWeb'
sys.path.append(str(project_root))

# Import DataStore after adjusting path
from Scripts.Utilities.DataStore import DataStore
```

### Handling Numpy Array Conversion to Pandas DataFrame

```python
# Ensure data is converted to DataFrame before saving
if isinstance(X_train, np.ndarray):
    X_train_df = pd.DataFrame(X_train)
X_train_df.to_csv(save_path_X_train, index=False)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Brainstorming:** Consider incorporating a logging mechanism that captures the time taken for each major processing step in the `DataHandler` pipeline, providing insights into performance bottlenecks.
- **Improvements:** Enhance the error messages for common issues like mismatched dimensions, guiding the user to correct them more efficiently.
- **Reflection:** The session highlighted the importance of thorough testing and error handling in complex data pipelines, ensuring that the project can scale effectively.
