# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_Config_Management_And_Debugging_In_StockTradingModel**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Debug the `StockTradingModel` class initialization, specifically focusing on the use of the `ConfigManager` to handle configuration settings and ensuring proper data fetching and storage functionality.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Updated the `StockTradingModel` class to correctly utilize the `ConfigManager` class for retrieving configuration settings.
  - Replaced the incorrect `.ini` file usage with the correct `.yaml` configuration file.
  - Verified the proper loading of CSV directories and database paths from the configuration file, ensuring seamless integration with the `DataStore` class.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** Initially faced an issue where the `ConfigManager.get()` method was being called with too many arguments, causing a `TypeError`.
  - **Breakthrough:** Successfully identified and corrected the misuse of the `ConfigManager.get()` method by aligning the number of arguments with the method’s signature. Also, ensured that the correct configuration file format was being used.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The updates ensure that the `StockTradingModel` class correctly initializes, fetches, and stores data based on configurations provided in a YAML file. This enhances the modularity and flexibility of the project, allowing easy changes to configuration settings without hardcoding values.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting, configuration management, and integration of data fetching with machine learning models.
- **Configuration Management:** Leveraged the `ConfigManager` class to handle environment variables and YAML-based configuration files.
- **Logging:** Employed logging to track configuration loading and debugging processes, ensuring traceability and easier issue resolution.
- **Data Handling:** Worked on data fetching from external APIs using `yfinance` and ensured proper storage using custom `DataStore` class.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Reinforced the importance of aligning function/method calls with their correct signatures, especially when dealing with configurable components.
  - Gained a deeper understanding of managing configurations via YAML files, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the project.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered a `TypeError` due to an incorrect number of arguments passed to the `ConfigManager.get()` method. This was resolved by revisiting the method’s implementation and adjusting the code accordingly.

- **Future Application:**
  - Ensure thorough documentation and testing of configurable components to prevent similar issues in the future. Moving forward, all configuration-related aspects will be handled via the `ConfigManager` for consistency.

---

## To-Do

- **Complete Unit Tests:** Finalize the unit tests for the `StockTradingModel` class to ensure robustness.
- **Refactor Code:** Clean up and refactor any remaining code to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect recent changes, especially the configuration management improvements.
- **Feature Implementation:** Begin working on integrating additional stock market indicators into the model for more comprehensive analysis.

## Code Snippets and Context

### StockTradingModel Initialization Update

```python
class StockTradingModel:
    def __init__(self, ticker, start_date, end_date, model_path='ppo_trading_model', transaction_cost=0.001, config_file='config.yaml'):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        self.model_path = model_path
        self.transaction_cost = transaction_cost

        # Initialize ConfigManager
        self.config_manager = ConfigManager(config_file)
        
        # Initialize DataStore
        data_store_config = {
            'csv_dir': self.config_manager.get('csv_dir', 'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data/alpha_vantage'),
            'db_path': self.config_manager.get('db_path', 'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data/trading_data.db')
        }

        self.data_store = DataStore(**data_store_config)

        self.data = self.fetch_stock_data()
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Brainstorming:** Consider adding error handling and validation checks within the `ConfigManager` to catch issues related to missing or misconfigured keys in the YAML files.
- **Improvements:** Enhance the logging setup to provide more detailed output, particularly during the initialization of critical components like `StockTradingModel`.
- **Reflection:** The adjustments made today are crucial for the stability and scalability of the project, especially as more configuration options are added in the future.

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** No formal meetings were held during this session.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to use the `config.yaml` file format for configuration management across the project.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Self: Begin using the new configuration setup consistently in all scripts moving forward.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Misconfiguration of YAML files could lead to runtime errors.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement validation checks within the `ConfigManager` to ensure all required keys and values are present and correctly formatted.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** Successfully debugged and improved the configuration management setup within the project, ensuring smoother initialization of the `StockTradingModel` class.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Need to focus on adding more detailed unit tests to catch potential configuration issues earlier.
- **Actionable Insights:** Establish a more thorough review process for any changes made to the configuration management system to prevent misconfigurations.
