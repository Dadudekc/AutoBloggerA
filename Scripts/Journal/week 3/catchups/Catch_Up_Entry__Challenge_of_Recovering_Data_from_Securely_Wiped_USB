# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Challenge_of_Recovering_Data_from_Securely_Wiped_USB**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The main goal was to explore and apply forensic techniques to recover data from a USB drive that was securely wiped by a PowerShell script, taking it on as a self-imposed challenge.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Reviewed the secure deletion PowerShell script to understand the mechanisms used for wiping the data.
  - Researched and outlined advanced forensic techniques that could potentially be used to recover data after secure deletion, such as low-level data recovery, analyzing unallocated space, and examining file system metadata.
  - Considered the importance of creating a disk image to preserve the current state of the USB drive before attempting any recovery operations.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - The secure deletion script effectively overwrote files with random data, making traditional recovery methods less effective. The challenge lies in the complexity of the data overwriting process.
  - A breakthrough was the realization that even after secure deletion, residual data might still exist in slack space, unallocated clusters, or as fragments detectable through data carving techniques.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The session resulted in a comprehensive plan of action for attempting data recovery. While success is not guaranteed due to the nature of secure deletion, the process itself is valuable for developing forensic analysis skills.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Forensic Analysis:** Applied forensic techniques such as data carving, slack space analysis, and metadata examination.
- **PowerShell Scripting:** Analyzed and understood the effects of a secure deletion script.
- **Disk Imaging:** Emphasized the importance of disk imaging as a precautionary measure in forensic analysis.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by secure deletion and the limits of data recovery.
  - Learned about advanced forensic tools and methods that could be used to recover data, even after it has been overwritten.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - The scriptâ€™s thorough approach to secure deletion presented a significant barrier to data recovery, highlighting the effectiveness of such scripts in protecting sensitive data.

- **Future Application:** 
  - These forensic techniques can be applied to future challenges involving data recovery, and the importance of disk imaging has been reinforced as a critical step before any recovery attempts.

---

## To-Do

- **Create Disk Image:** Use a tool like FTK Imager to create a forensic disk image of the USB drive.
- **Attempt Data Carving:** Use tools like `foremost` or `Scalpel` on the disk image to search for recoverable data fragments.
- **Analyze Unallocated Space:** Investigate the unallocated space for potential remnants of deleted files using tools like `Autopsy`.
- **File Slack Space Examination:** Explore the possibility of recovering file fragments from slack space using a hex editor or specialized forensic tools.

## Code Snippets and Context

The focus of this session was on forensic analysis and did not involve the development of new code. However, the provided PowerShell script was critically analyzed:

### Secure Deletion PowerShell Script

```powershell
# Securely deletes files by overwriting them with random data and then deleting them.
function Secure-Delete {
    param([string]$path)
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $path -Recurse -Force
    foreach ($file in $files) {
        # Overwrite the file with random data
        $fileSize = (Get-Item $file.FullName).length
        $randomData = New-Object byte[] $fileSize
        (New-Object Random).NextBytes($randomData)
        [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($file.FullName, $randomData)
        # Securely delete the file
        Remove-Item -Path $file.FullName -Force
    }
}
```

This script served as the basis for understanding the complexity of the data recovery challenge.

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** If similar challenges arise, consider setting up a controlled environment to test recovery techniques without risking data loss.
- **Reflection:** This exercise highlights the importance of secure deletion tools for protecting sensitive information and the difficulty in recovering data after such measures are taken.

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** No formal meetings; this was an independent challenge.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to proceed with advanced forensic techniques to attempt data recovery.
- **Action Items:** Continue with the outlined recovery strategy using the disk image.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Data loss due to improper handling of the USB drive during the recovery process.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Use a disk image for all recovery attempts, leaving the original USB drive untouched.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** Developed a thorough plan for attempting data recovery using advanced forensic techniques.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Time management could be better, as more time could have been dedicated to experimenting with the actual recovery tools.
- **Actionable Insights:** Prioritize creating disk images before attempting any forensic recovery to ensure the integrity of the original data.
