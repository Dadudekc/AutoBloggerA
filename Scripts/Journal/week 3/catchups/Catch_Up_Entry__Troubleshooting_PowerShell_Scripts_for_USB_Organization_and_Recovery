# Catch_Up_Entry__Troubleshooting_PowerShell_Scripts_for_USB_Organization_and_Recovery

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Troubleshoot and resolve errors encountered while running a PowerShell script intended for organizing a USB drive for Tails Linux setup.
  - Ensure correct file types and extensions are used in PowerShell scripts.
  
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Identified the error related to PowerShell not recognizing the file type 'quick,ps1' due to an incorrect file extension.
  - Provided guidance on verifying and correcting file extensions to ensure compatibility with PowerShell.
  - Suggested running the script manually and adjusting PowerShellâ€™s execution policy if needed.
  
- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** PowerShell was unable to debug the script due to incorrect file type recognition.
  - **Breakthrough:** Recognizing that file extensions must be correct for PowerShell to run scripts, leading to the resolution of the issue by correcting the file extension.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The troubleshooting process highlighted the importance of proper file naming conventions and execution policy settings in PowerShell. Ensuring these aspects are correct will streamline script execution and prevent similar issues in the future.

## Code Snippets and Context

```powershell
# Example PowerShell command to create directories on a USB drive
New-Item -Path $tailsSetupDir -ItemType Directory -Force

# Example command to move files to the appropriate directory
Move-Item -Path (Join-Path $usbDrive "mlrobot extras") -Destination $toolsDir -Force
```
