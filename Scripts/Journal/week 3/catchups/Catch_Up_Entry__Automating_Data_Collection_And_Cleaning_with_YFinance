# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Automating_Data_Collection_And_Cleaning_with_YFinance**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Automate the collection and cleaning of stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library to reduce dependency on Alpha Vantage API calls.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Selected key stock symbols for data collection.
  - Developed a Python script to fetch historical stock data for these symbols from Yahoo Finance.
  - Implemented data cleaning processes to ensure data quality, including handling missing values.
  - Set up the script to save the cleaned data locally in CSV format to minimize repeated API calls.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenges:** Encountered issues with data inconsistencies across different stock symbols.
  - **Breakthroughs:** Optimized the data cleaning process to handle these inconsistencies effectively.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - Successfully reduced the number of required Alpha Vantage API calls by storing cleaned historical data locally.
  - Enhanced the data availability for users, leading to faster access and reduced latency in data processing.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used for scripting the data collection and cleaning processes.
- **yfinance Library:** Utilized to fetch stock data efficiently from Yahoo Finance.
- **Pandas Library:** Employed for data manipulation and storage, critical in cleaning and saving the data.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained a deeper understanding of data collection automation with `yfinance`.
  - Improved skills in data cleaning and preprocessing for financial datasets.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Dealing with API limitations and data inconsistencies required adaptive solutions.

- **Future Application:** 
  - Plan to apply these data handling skills to other financial data sources, possibly integrating more robust error handling and data validation steps.

---

## To-Do

- **Enhance Data Cleaning Logic:** Further refine the data cleaning process to handle edge cases and anomalies.
- **Expand Symbol List:** Consider including more stock symbols based on user feedback and usage patterns.
- **Regular Updates:** Set up a schedule to update the saved datasets periodically to ensure data freshness.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Data Fetch and Clean Script

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import os

symbols = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']
start_date = '2023-01-01'
end_date = '2023-12-31'
data_directory = 'C:\\TheTradingRobotPlug\\data'

for symbol in symbols:
    data = yf.download(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    file_path = os.path.join(data_directory, f"{symbol}_data.csv")
    data.to_csv(file_path)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** Consider implementing parallel processing to speed up the data fetching process for multiple stocks.
- **Reflection:** This automation not only saves on API usage costs but also aligns with our project's goal of efficient data management.

---

## Project Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Initial data collection setup - **Completed**
- **Milestone 2:** Data cleaning and local storage implementation - **In Progress**
- **Milestone 3:** Integration with main project framework - **Pending**

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Dependency on external APIs could lead to issues in data availability and integrity.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly validate the fetched data and explore alternative data sources as backups.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** Efficient implementation of the `yfinance` data fetching and the integration with our local storage solutions.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Need to optimize the script for handling a larger array of stock symbols.
- **Actionable Insights:** Explore the use of asynchronous programming to fetch data for multiple stocks concurrently, reducing overall script execution time.
