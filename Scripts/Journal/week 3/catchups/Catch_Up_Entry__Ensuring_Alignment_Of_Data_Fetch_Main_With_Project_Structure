# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Ensuring_Alignment_Of_Data_Fetch_Main_With_Project_Structure**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - The primary objective was to review the `data_fetch_main.py` file and ensure it aligns with the project structure and logging standards. Additionally, any inconsistencies in naming conventions or file handling were to be identified and addressed.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reviewed the `data_fetch_main.py` file thoroughly to ensure it is correctly set up with logging, data fetching, and saving mechanisms in line with the project's structure.
  - Verified that the log files are directed to the correct location in the `logs` directory and that the environment variables are loaded properly.
  - Checked the paths and imports to ensure they are consistent with the project’s organization, making use of the `Pathlib` module for cross-platform compatibility.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - No major challenges were encountered during this session. A significant point of attention was ensuring that the fetched data is saved in a consistent and organized manner, especially with fallback mechanisms like using Yahoo Finance.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The review confirmed that the `data_fetch_main.py` file is well-aligned with the project structure. Proper logging is implemented, ensuring that all activities are tracked and errors are recorded. The impact is an increased consistency across the project, improving maintainability and clarity.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting the data fetching process, including error handling and logging.
- **Logging:** Implemented robust logging to track the script’s execution and any issues that arise.
- **Path Management:** Leveraged the `Pathlib` module for managing file paths in a cross-platform manner.
- **Data Handling:** Ensured that data fetched from APIs is correctly saved and organized for future use.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Used Python’s `asyncio` for efficient asynchronous data fetching.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Reaffirmed the importance of consistent logging across the project for easier debugging and monitoring.
  - Recognized the value of organizing fetched data in a structured manner, which will simplify future data analysis and model training.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - None encountered during this session.

- **Future Application:**
  - The insights from this review will be applied to other scripts within the project to ensure that they all align with the overall project structure and standards. This will include a focus on consistent naming conventions and proper file handling.

---

## To-Do

- **Log File Naming Standardization:** Review other log files in the project to ensure consistent naming conventions.
- **Directory Structure Validation:** Validate that other scripts in the `DataFetchers` directory save data in the correct subdirectories.
- **Documentation Update:** Update project documentation to reflect any changes made during this review.
- **Next Script Review:** Proceed to review the next script (`alpha_vantage_fetcher.py`) to ensure alignment with the project structure.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Path Setup and Logging Initialization

```python
# Ensuring the project root is added to the path for imports
script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
project_root = script_dir.parent.parent
sys.path.append(str(project_root))

# Logging setup
logger = DataFetchUtils(str(project_root / "logs" / "data_fetch_main.log")).logger
```

### Fetching Data Asynchronously

```python
async def fetch_data(symbols, start_date, end_date):
    """
    Asynchronously fetches historical data for multiple symbols from various sources.
    """
    alpha_vantage_fetcher = AlphaVantageDataFetcher()
    polygon_fetcher = PolygonDataFetcher()
    data_store = DataStore()
    fetched_files = []

    async def fetch_and_save(fetcher, symbol):
        try:
            df = await fetcher.fetch_data_for_symbol(symbol, start_date, end_date)
            if df is not None and not df.empty:
                fetcher.save_data(df, symbol, processed=False, overwrite=True)
                fetched_files.append(f"{symbol}_{fetcher.source.lower()}_data.csv")
                logger.info(f"{fetcher.source} data fetched and saved for {symbol}")
                return df
            else:
                logger.warning(f"No data fetched for {symbol} from {fetcher.source}.")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error fetching data for {symbol} from {fetcher.source}: {e}")
        return None

    await asyncio.gather(*[fetch_and_save(alpha_vantage_fetcher, symbol) for symbol in symbols])
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** Standardizing file and log naming conventions will prevent future confusion and make the project easier to navigate.
- **Reflection:** The current setup is robust, but regular reviews and refactoring are essential to maintain alignment with project goals and structure.

## Project Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Initial setup and configuration - Completed
- **Milestone 2:** Data fetch module implementation - In Progress
- **Milestone 3:** Unit testing and validation - Pending
- **Milestone 4:** Final integration and deployment - Pending

## Resource Links

- Not applicable for this session, as the focus was on internal review and alignment.

---

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** No meetings were held during this session.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to proceed with reviewing and aligning other scripts to the project structure.
- **Action Items:**
  - Begin the next review session focusing on `alpha_vantage_fetcher.py` to ensure alignment with the project’s structure.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Potential for inconsistent log file naming across different modules.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Conduct a comprehensive review and refactor log file names where necessary to ensure consistency.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** The alignment review of the `data_fetch_main.py` script was completed without any major issues, ensuring consistency across the project.
- **What Could Be Improved:** The process could benefit from a checklist to ensure all scripts are reviewed and aligned systematically.
- **Actionable Insights:** Implement a standardized log file naming convention across the project.
