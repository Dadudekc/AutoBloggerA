# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Modifying_WebSocket_Script_For_Stock_Market_Data_Handling**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Update the WebSocket script to clean and standardize incoming stock market data. Ensure the data is ready for further analysis and visualization, such as creating a candlestick chart.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Modified the `on_message` method in the `FinnhubWebSocket` class to handle and clean incoming data.
  - Implemented the `clean_data` method to standardize the data format and extract relevant fields.
  - Integrated the cleaned data processing into the WebSocket message handling to ensure it prints clean, structured data.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenges:** Handling JSON decoding errors and ensuring the cleaned data format aligns with the requirements.
  - **Breakthroughs:** Successfully implemented a data cleaning process that standardizes data entries, making it ready for visualization and analysis.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The updated WebSocket script now processes incoming stock data more effectively. Cleaned data can be directly used for generating visualizations like candlestick charts, improving overall project functionality and data analysis.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used for scripting, data handling, and WebSocket integration.
- **JSON Handling:** Applied for parsing and cleaning incoming WebSocket messages.
- **Data Standardization:** Implemented methods to format and clean data for consistency and usability.
- **WebSocket Communication:** Managed real-time data streaming and processing.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Gained experience in handling real-time WebSocket data and cleaning it for further use.
  - Improved understanding of data structure standardization and its importance in data analysis.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered issues with inconsistent data formats and JSON parsing errors, which were resolved by adding robust error handling and data cleaning processes.

- **Future Application:**
  - The skills and methods developed will be applied to other real-time data handling projects, enhancing the capability to process and analyze streaming data effectively.

---

## To-Do

- **Implement Visualization:** Use the cleaned data to generate a candlestick chart using Plotly.
- **Error Handling Enhancement:** Improve error handling for edge cases in data processing.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the updated WebSocket script with different data scenarios to ensure robustness.

## Code Snippets and Context

### WebSocket Script

```python
import json
from websocket import WebSocketApp
import websocket
import os

class FinnhubWebSocket:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.ws_url = f"wss://ws.finnhub.io?token={self.api_key}"

    def on_message(self, ws, message):
        try:
            data = json.loads(message)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print("Error: Invalid JSON data")
            return
        
        if 'data' in data:
            cleaned_data = self.clean_data(data['data'])
            print("Cleaned Data:", json.dumps(cleaned_data, indent=2))
        else:
            print("No 'data' field found in the message")

    def clean_data(self, raw_data):
        standardized_data = []
        
        for entry in raw_data:
            cleaned_entry = {
                "symbol": entry.get("s", ""),
                "price": entry.get("p", 0),
                "volume": entry.get("v", 0),
                "timestamp": entry.get("t", 0),
                "categories": entry.get("c", [])
            }
            standardized_data.append(cleaned_entry)
        
        return standardized_data

    def on_error(self, ws, error):
        print(f"Error: {error}")

    def on_close(self, ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
        print("Connection closed")

    def on_open(self, ws):
        print("Connection opened")

    def start(self):
        ws = WebSocketApp(self.ws_url,
                          on_message=self.on_message,
                          on_error=self.on_error,
                          on_close=self.on_close)
        ws.on_open = self.on_open
        ws.run_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    finnhub_api_key = os.getenv('FINNHUB_API_KEY')
    if finnhub_api_key:
        ws_client = FinnhubWebSocket(finnhub_api_key)
        ws_client.start()
    else:
        print("Finnhub API key is not set.")
```
