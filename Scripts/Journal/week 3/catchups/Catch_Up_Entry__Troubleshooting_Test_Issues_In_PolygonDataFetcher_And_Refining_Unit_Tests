**Catch_Up_Entry__Troubleshooting_Test_Issues_In_PolygonDataFetcher_And_Refining_Unit_Tests**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The primary goal was to debug and refine the unit tests for the `PolygonDataFetcher` class, ensuring that all methods, particularly `fetch_data_for_symbol` and `extract_results`, are correctly implemented and tested.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - **Debugging the Test Setup:** Analyzed and corrected the `PolygonDataFetcher` class methods, ensuring the `extract_results` method was properly implemented and accessible.
  - **Test Integration:** Integrated the `extract_results` method within the test cases, ensuring that the test environment correctly references and utilizes the methods in the `PolygonDataFetcher` class.
  - **Mocking Dependencies:** Correctly mocked dependencies such as `logging` and `fetch_data` to isolate the functionality under test.
  - **Execution of Tests:** Ran the tests multiple times, addressing errors related to coroutine handling and method accessibility.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenges:** 
    - Initial errors due to missing or incorrectly named methods in the `PolygonDataFetcher` class led to failed tests.
    - Handling asynchronous methods in unit tests required proper configuration and mocking.
  - **Breakthroughs:** 
    - Successfully integrated and tested the `extract_results` method, ensuring that it processes API data as expected.
    - Resolved coroutine-related issues by ensuring proper use of `async` and `await` in test cases.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The successful implementation and testing of the `extract_results` method solidified the reliability of the `PolygonDataFetcher` class.
  - Ensured that the class can handle API responses, extract relevant data, and convert it into a pandas DataFrame for further use, which is crucial for the project's data analysis and processing pipeline.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Utilized for scripting, data manipulation, and managing asynchronous operations within the `PolygonDataFetcher` class.
- **Unit Testing:** Employed `unittest` with `unittest.mock` for isolating and testing specific functionalities in the class.
- **Asyncio and Aiohttp:** Managed asynchronous API calls and responses, crucial for real-time data fetching in a non-blocking manner.
- **Logging:** Implemented detailed logging to monitor API calls, data processing, and error handling.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained a deeper understanding of handling asynchronous methods in unit tests and the importance of proper coroutine management.
  - Reinforced the importance of thorough debugging when methods are reported as missing or inaccessible in test cases.
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered issues related to coroutine handling in `unittest`, which required a better understanding of Python's asynchronous programming features.
- **Future Application:** 
  - This experience will guide future test implementations, particularly in ensuring that all methods are properly defined and accessible before initiating tests. It also highlighted the importance of integrating robust logging for easier debugging.

---

## To-Do
- **Refine Real-Time Data Tests:** Develop and implement unit tests for the `fetch_real_time_data` method, ensuring it handles API responses and processes data correctly.
- **Expand Test Coverage:** Increase test coverage to include edge cases and potential failure scenarios for all methods in `PolygonDataFetcher`.
- **Documentation:** Update project documentation to include details on the `PolygonDataFetcher` class and its integration into the data processing pipeline.

## Code Snippets and Context

### PolygonDataFetcher Class

```python
class PolygonDataFetcher(DataFetcher):
    # Existing code...

    def extract_results(self, data):
        results = []
        for entry in data.get('results', []):
            result = {
                'date': pd.to_datetime(entry['t'], unit='ms').date().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
                'open': entry['o'],
                'high': entry['h'],
                'low': entry['l'],
                'close': entry['c'],
                'volume': entry['v']
            }
            results.append(result)
        return results
```

### Test Case for Extract Results

```python
@patch('Scripts.Data_Fetchers.polygon_fetcher.logging')
def test_extract_results(self, mock_logging):
    data = {
        'results': [
            {'t': 1620086400000, 'o': 100.0, 'h': 110.0, 'l': 95.0, 'c': 105.0, 'v': 1000},
            {'t': 1620172800000, 'o': 105.0, 'h': 115.0, 'l': 100.0, 'c': 110.0, 'v': 1500}
        ]
    }
    results = self.fetcher.extract_results(data)
    self.assertEqual(len(results), 2)
    self.assertEqual(results[0]['date'], '2021-05-04')
    self.assertEqual(results[1]['close'], 110.0)
```
