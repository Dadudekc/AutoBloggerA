# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_Path_Issues_And_Config_File_Standardization**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered in the `config_handling.py` script.
  - Standardize and update the `config.yaml` and `config.ini` files to align with the updated project directory structure.

- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Investigated the `KeyError: 'Paths'` issue in the `config_handling.py` script.
  - Identified that the error was due to an outdated or incorrect path reference in the `config.ini` file.
  - Updated the `config.yaml` and `config.ini` files to reflect the correct paths in the new project structure.
  - Verified that the changes resolved the error by re-running the script without encountering any further issues.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - The main challenge was diagnosing the source of the `KeyError`, which was quickly resolved by checking the configuration files.
  - A breakthrough came in realizing the importance of maintaining up-to-date configuration files as the project structure evolves, which will prevent similar issues in the future.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The updates to the configuration files ensured that the project is now correctly aligned with the new directory structure, eliminating the `KeyError` and improving the overall stability of the project.
  - These changes will contribute to smoother project execution, particularly when loading and saving data.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used for scripting and debugging the `config_handling.py` script.
- **Configuration Management:** Updated and standardized the `config.yaml` and `config.ini` files to match the project's directory structure.
- **Troubleshooting:** Quickly identified and resolved a configuration-related error that was preventing the script from running correctly.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - The importance of regularly updating configuration files to match the project's directory structure.
  - Gained further experience in troubleshooting configuration errors in Python projects.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Encountered an issue where the configuration file did not reflect the current project structure, leading to a script error.
  
- **Future Application:** 
  - Will apply the knowledge of maintaining configuration files across all scripts and ensure they are updated whenever the project structure changes.

---

## To-Do

- **Verify Configurations:** Check other scripts in the project to ensure that they are also using the updated configuration files.
- **Continue Standardization:** Continue the standardization process across other parts of the project to maintain consistency and avoid similar issues.
- **Documentation Update:** Update the project documentation to reflect the changes made to the configuration files.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Updated Configuration Files

**config.yaml:**

```yaml
Paths:
  data_folder: 'data'
  loading_path: 'data'
  saving_path: 'data'
  logs: 'logs'

API:
  api_key: 'your_api_key'
  base_url: 'https://api.example.com'
  timeout: 30

DATABASE:
  db_name: 'default_db'
  db_user: 'default_user'
```

**config.ini:**

```ini
[Paths]
data_folder = data
loading_path = data
saving_path = data
logs = logs

[UserSettings]

[API]
api_key = default_api_key
base_url = https://api.example.com
timeout = 30

[DATABASE]
db_name = default_db
db_user = default_user
```

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** None for this session.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to standardize and update all configuration files across the project.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Self: Ensure that all scripts are aligned with the updated configuration files.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Configuration file mismatches leading to runtime errors.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a verification routine to check configuration file accuracy after each project update.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** The error was quickly identified and resolved, leading to improved project stability.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Establishing a proactive approach to updating configuration files whenever the project structure changes.
- **Actionable Insights:** Regular checks and updates to configuration files will prevent similar issues in the future, ensuring the project remains on track.
