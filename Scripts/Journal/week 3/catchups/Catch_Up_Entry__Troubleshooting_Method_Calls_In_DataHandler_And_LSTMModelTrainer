# Catch_Up_Entry__Troubleshooting_Method_Calls_In_DataHandler_And_LSTMModelTrainer

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Diagnose and resolve the `TypeError` related to the `create_sequences` method in the `LSTMModelTrainer` class within the `DataHandler.py` script.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reviewed the `create_sequences` method definition and its call to ensure correct usage.
  - Added print statements for debugging to verify the arguments being passed to the method.
  - Cleared the `__pycache__` directories to ensure there were no cached versions causing the issue.
  - Tested the method in an isolated script to determine if the error persisted outside the project's environment.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - Encountered a persistent `TypeError` indicating that the `target` argument was missing, despite being passed correctly.
  - The breakthrough came when isolating the code in a separate script, which confirmed that the method worked correctly in isolation, suggesting an issue with the project environment or import paths.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - Identified that the issue might be related to conflicting versions of the class or file caching. The isolated test provided clarity that the method itself was implemented correctly.
  - The findings will guide further investigation into the project structure and import paths to resolve the issue within the full project context.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** 
  - Used for scripting, debugging, and testing the `create_sequences` method.
- **Debugging Techniques:**
  - Applied print statement debugging and isolated testing to diagnose issues.
- **Version Control (Git):** 
  - Utilized to manage changes and experiment with different approaches to resolve the error.
- **PowerShell:** 
  - Employed to clear the `__pycache__` directories and manage the project's file system.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Realized the importance of clearing cache files and ensuring that the correct version of the script is being executed, especially when dealing with persistent errors.
  - Recognized that isolating code for testing can be a powerful technique to differentiate between code errors and environmental issues.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - The persistent `TypeError` despite correct method usage highlighted the complexities of working within larger projects where multiple factors can influence code execution.

- **Future Application:**
  - Moving forward, I will incorporate routine cache clearing and isolated testing into my debugging workflow to quickly identify whether issues are related to code logic or project environment.

---

## To-Do

- **Investigate Import Paths:** 
  - Thoroughly check the project for any conflicting definitions or incorrect imports that might be causing the error within the `DataHandler.py` script.
- **Clear Cache Files Regularly:** 
  - Implement a script to automatically clear `__pycache__` directories to avoid running outdated versions of files.
- **Finalize Debugging:** 
  - Once the environment is confirmed to be consistent, re-run the project script to ensure the `create_sequences` method operates as expected.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Isolated Test Script for `create_sequences`

```python
import numpy as np

class LSTMModelTrainer:
    def __init__(self, logger=None, model_save_path='best_model.keras', scaler_save_path='scaler.pkl'):
        self.logger = logger
        self.model_save_path = model_save_path
        self.scaler_save_path = scaler_save_path

    def create_sequences(self, data, target, time_steps=10):
        xs, ys = [], []
        for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
            x = data[i:(i + time_steps)]
            y = target[i + time_steps]
            xs.append(x)
            ys.append(y)
        return np.array(xs), np.array(ys)

# Example usage
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100)
trainer = LSTMModelTrainer()
X_train_seq, y_train_seq = trainer.create_sequences(X_train, y_train, time_steps=10)
print("X_train_seq shape:", X_train_seq.shape)
print("y_train_seq shape:", y_train_seq.shape)
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** 
  - Consider restructuring the project to reduce complexity and potential conflicts, particularly around import paths and class definitions.
- **Reflection:** 
  - This debugging session reinforced the importance of environmental consistency and the value of isolating code to pinpoint issues.

---

## Project Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Initial setup and configuration - Completed
- **Milestone 2:** Data fetch module implementation - In Progress
- **Milestone 3:** Unit testing and validation - Pending
- **Milestone 4:** Final integration and deployment - Pending

---

## Resource Links

- Not applicable for this session, as the focus was on internal debugging and testing.

---

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** 
  - No formal meetings were held during this session.
- **Decisions Made:** 
  - Decided to continue troubleshooting by focusing on potential environment-related issues.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Self: Complete investigation of import paths and resolve any environment-related conflicts.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Persistent environmental issues could delay further progress.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Allocate time to thoroughly investigate and resolve any environment-related issues before proceeding with new development tasks.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** 
  - Successfully isolated the issue to determine that the `create_sequences` method itself was functioning correctly.
- **What Could Be Improved:** 
  - Need to improve the consistency of the project environment to avoid similar issues in the future.
- **Actionable Insights:** 
  - Regular cache clearing and environmental checks should become a standard part of the workflow to prevent similar issues from occurring.
