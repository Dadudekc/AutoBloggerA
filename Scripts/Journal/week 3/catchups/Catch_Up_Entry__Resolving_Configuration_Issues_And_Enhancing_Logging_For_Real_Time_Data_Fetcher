# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_Configuration_Issues_And_Enhancing_Logging_For_Real_Time_Data_Fetcher**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - Resolve configuration-related issues in the `real_time_fetcher.py` script, particularly related to missing configuration keys.
  - Enhance the logging setup within the `config_handling.py` script to ensure consistent and error-free logging across the project.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Identified that the `REAL_TIME_RAW_CSV_DIR` configuration key was missing, causing the script to fail.
  - Reviewed and modified the `config_handling.py` script to ensure that all necessary configuration keys are correctly loaded, with default values provided where necessary.
  - Fixed a `NameError` in the logging setup by ensuring the `log_file` variable was correctly defined before usage.
  - Removed redundant calls to `logging.basicConfig` to prevent conflicts and ensure centralized logging is handled consistently.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - **Challenge:** The main challenge was tracking down why the `REAL_TIME_RAW_CSV_DIR` configuration key wasn't being recognized, despite being set with a default value.
  - **Breakthrough:** The issue was resolved by reviewing the order and method in which configuration values were loaded and ensuring defaults were applied correctly. Additionally, fixing the logging setup by correctly defining the `log_file` variable prevented further runtime errors.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The `real_time_fetcher.py` script now correctly retrieves the `REAL_TIME_RAW_CSV_DIR` configuration and runs without errors. The logging setup in `config_handling.py` is now more robust, ensuring that logs are consistently written without conflicts. This enhances the reliability of the entire system and aids in better tracking of issues during runtime.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used for scripting and debugging the `real_time_fetcher.py` and `config_handling.py` scripts.
- **Logging:** Improved the logging setup by ensuring proper configuration and avoiding redundant setup calls.
- **Configuration Management:** Enhanced the robustness of the configuration management system by ensuring all required keys are correctly handled with defaults.
- **Error Handling:** Addressed and resolved errors related to undefined variables and missing configurations, improving the overall stability of the code.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Learned the importance of ensuring all configuration keys are correctly defined and handled, with defaults applied where necessary to prevent runtime errors.
  - Recognized the value of centralized logging setup to avoid conflicts and ensure that logs are written consistently.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered an unexpected issue with a `NameError` in the logging setup, which was resolved by ensuring variables are correctly defined before use.

- **Future Application:**
  - Going forward, ensure that all configuration keys are thoroughly checked and validated during initial script setup. Additionally, review logging setups in new scripts to prevent similar issues.

---

## To-Do

- **Finalize Configuration Validation:** Add further validation to ensure all critical configuration keys are present and correctly set up.
- **Expand Logging Features:** Implement more detailed logging across other scripts to improve monitoring and debugging capabilities.
- **Refactor Code:** Review other scripts for potential improvements in configuration and logging setup.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Updated Logging Setup

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Scripts\Utilities\config_handling.py

def setup_logging(script_name=None):
    """Set up centralized logging, with log files named after the script."""
    log_folder = "C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/logs"

    # Create log folder if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(log_folder):
        os.makedirs(log_folder)

    if script_name is None:
        script_name = "trading_robot"  # Default log file name
    else:
        script_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(script_name))[0]

    # Define log_file before using it in logging.basicConfig
    log_file = os.path.join(log_folder, f"{script_name}.log")

    # Now use log_file in logging.basicConfig
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.DEBUG,  # Set to DEBUG level as per your requirement
        format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        filename=log_file,
        filemode='w'
    )

    logger = logging.getLogger(script_name)
    logger.info(f"Logging started for {script_name}")

    return logger
```

### Configuration Value Retrieval with Default

```python
# C:\TheTradingRobotPlug\Scripts\Utilities\config_handling.py

def get_config_value(key, config, yaml_config=None, section='DEFAULT', skip_wizard=True):
    """Retrieve a configuration value from the highest priority source."""
    key = key.upper()
    section = section.upper()

    # 1. Check environment variable
    value = os.getenv(key)
    if value:
        logger.debug(f"Environment variable {key} retrieved with value: {value}")
        return value

    # 2. Check INI file
    if config.has_option(section, key):
        value = config.get(section, key)
        logger.debug(f"Config file value {key} retrieved with value: {value}")
        return value

    # 3. Check YAML file
    if yaml_config and key in yaml_config:
        value = yaml_config[key]
        logger.debug(f"YAML config value {key} retrieved with value: {value}")
        return value

    defaults = {
        'REAL_TIME_RAW_CSV_DIR': 'C:/TheTradingRobotPlug/data',
        # Other defaults
    }

    if key in defaults:
        logger.debug(f"Using default value for {key}: {defaults[key]}")
        return defaults[key]

    if not skip_wizard:
        logger.debug(f"No value found for {key} in environment, INI file, or YAML.")
        return None

    return None  # Skip user prompts completely
```
