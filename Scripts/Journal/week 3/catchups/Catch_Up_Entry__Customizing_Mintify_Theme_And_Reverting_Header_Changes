# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Customizing_Mintify_Theme_And_Reverting_Header_Changes**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:**
  - The primary objective was to customize the Mintify WordPress theme for the Trading Robot Plug Web project, specifically focusing on the header section.
  - Additionally, revert unintended changes made to the header to restore functionality and maintain the design integrity.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Explored and discussed different options for creating a child theme and implementing custom functionality within the Mintify framework.
  - Decided to use Mintify as the base theme after considering alternatives.
  - Restored the header to a more manageable and functional state by simplifying the structure and removing unnecessary customizations.
  - Reimplemented essential elements like navigation, logo, and search functionality using WordPress's dynamic functions to ensure seamless integration.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**
  - A key challenge was managing the complexity of the custom header template, which led to layout issues.
  - The breakthrough was realizing that simplifying the header structure and relying on WordPress's built-in functionalities could resolve the issues while still allowing for future customizations.

- **Results and Impact:**
  - The header was successfully reverted to a functional state, retaining necessary elements like the logo, navigation, and search functionality.
  - This work ensures that the website remains user-friendly and visually consistent with the Mintify theme's design principles.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **WordPress Theme Development:** Utilized to customize and manage the Mintify theme's header.
- **PHP and HTML:** Applied in creating and editing WordPress theme templates.
- **WordPress Hooks and Functions:** Leveraged to ensure dynamic content (like site title and menus) is correctly displayed.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - The importance of keeping customizations manageable and leveraging built-in WordPress functions for dynamic content.
  - Gained a deeper understanding of WordPress block templates and how to efficiently revert changes without disrupting the overall site functionality.

- **Unexpected Challenges:**
  - Encountered issues with layout consistency due to overly complex customizations in the header, which required reverting and simplifying the code.

- **Future Application:**
  - Future customizations will be approached more cautiously, ensuring that any changes are easily reversible and do not disrupt the overall site layout.

---

## To-Do

- **Child Theme Setup:** Begin setting up a child theme for Mintify to safely manage customizations moving forward.
- **Header Customization:** Incrementally add desired features back into the header within the child theme, ensuring functionality is retained.
- **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect the changes made and best practices for future customizations.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Simplified Header Template

```php
<div class="wp-block-group alignfull has-filter is-style-default has-transparent-background-color has-background" style="border-bottom-style:none;border-bottom-width:0px">
  <!-- Notification bar -->
  <div class="wp-block-group alignfull is-style-light">
    <p class="aligncenter">Save 50% on all products for a limited time â†’</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Main header content -->
  <div class="wp-block-group alignfull" style="padding:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xxs)">
    <div class="wp-block-group alignwide" style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(12,minmax(0,1fr))">
      <div class="wp-block-group" style="grid-column:1/3">
        <a href="<?php echo esc_url(home_url('/')); ?>" class="wp-block-site-title">Your Site</a>
      </div>
      <div class="wp-block-group" style="grid-column:3/11;display:flex;justify-content:center">
        <nav class="wp-block-navigation">
          <?php
          wp_nav_menu(array(
            'theme_location' => 'primary',
