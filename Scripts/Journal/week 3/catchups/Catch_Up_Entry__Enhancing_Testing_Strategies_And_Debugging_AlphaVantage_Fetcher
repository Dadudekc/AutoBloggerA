# Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_Testing_Strategies_And_Debugging_AlphaVantage_Fetcher

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - The primary goal was to fix the failing unit tests in the `test_alpha_vantage_fetcher.py` file and ensure that the `AlphaVantageDataFetcher` class in `alpha_vantage_fetcher.py` works as expected.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - The environment variables for the API key were patched to ensure that tests do not fail due to the actual key being used in the API URL.
  - Debugged the `fetch_data_for_symbol` method to ensure it returns a `pandas.DataFrame` instead of `None`.
  - Reviewed and updated the `test_construct_api_url` and `test_fetch_data_for_symbol` unit tests to ensure they reflect the expected outcomes.
  - Re-ran the tests multiple times after making adjustments to verify that all issues were resolved.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenges:** The primary challenge was identifying why the API key patch wasn't being correctly applied, which led to discrepancies in the test outputs.
  - **Breakthroughs:** Successfully patching the environment variable and debugging the `fetch_data_for_symbol` method led to clearer test outputs and a better understanding of the method's operation.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The tests are now closer to passing, with the root causes of the initial failures identified and addressed. This progress will improve the reliability of the `AlphaVantageDataFetcher` class, ensuring that it functions correctly in the larger project.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Key for modifying and debugging the code within the `alpha_vantage_fetcher.py` and test files.
- **Unit Testing:** Used `unittest` and `unittest.mock` to create and run unit tests, ensuring the functionality of the `AlphaVantageDataFetcher`.
- **API Integration:** Ensured the correct usage of the Alpha Vantage API within the fetcher class.
- **Debugging:** Applied debugging techniques to trace and fix issues within the code and tests.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Reinforced the importance of correctly patching environment variables in unit tests to avoid test failures related to real-world API keys.
  - Gained deeper insights into how asynchronous functions in Python should be tested, particularly when dealing with external APIs.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - The persistence of API key mismatches in test cases due to improper patching.
  - Handling of empty DataFrames in tests when the data fetching failed silently.

- **Future Application:** 
  - Apply the learned debugging techniques and environment variable patching strategies to future tests.
  - Consider writing more comprehensive error-handling code in data-fetching functions to prevent silent failures and make debugging easier.

## To-Do

- **Refactor Test Cases:** Improve the structure and clarity of the remaining tests for `AlphaVantageDataFetcher`.
- **Finalize Fixes:** Ensure all tests in `test_alpha_vantage_fetcher.py` pass without issues.
- **Documentation Update:** Update project documentation to reflect changes and fixes made in the data fetcher and tests.
- **Explore Data Caching:** Investigate implementing a caching mechanism for fetched data to reduce API calls and improve efficiency.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Construct API URL Test Case

```python
@patch.dict('os.environ', {'ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY': 'ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY'})
def test_construct_api_url(self):
    url = self.fetcher.construct_api_url("AAPL")
    expected_url = "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=AAPL&interval=1min&apikey=ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY&outputsize=full&datatype=json"
    self.assertEqual(url, expected_url)
```
*Context:* This snippet demonstrates the correct patching of the environment variable for the API key, ensuring that the test URL matches the expected format.

### Fetch Data for Symbol Test Case

```python
def test_fetch_data_for_symbol(self):
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    result = loop.run_until_complete(self.fetch_data(self.symbol, self.start_date, self.end_date))
    loop.close()

    self.assertIsNotNone(result)
    self.assertIsInstance(result, pd.DataFrame)
    self.assertFalse(result.empty)
    self.assertIn('open', result.columns)
    self.assertIn('high', result.columns)
    self.assertIn('low', result.columns)
    self.assertIn('close', result.columns)
    self.assertIn('volume', result.columns)
    self.assertIn('symbol', result.columns)
```
*Context:* This snippet highlights the test for fetching data and ensuring that the result is a non-empty DataFrame with the expected columns.

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Brainstorming:** Consider adding an additional test to check for the proper handling of rate-limiting errors by the API.
- **Improvements:** Further enhance the error handling within the `fetch_data_for_symbol` method to capture and log more specific issues.
- **Reflection:** This session underscored the importance of robust testing practices and thorough debugging, especially when dealing with third-party APIs.
