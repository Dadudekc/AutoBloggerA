# Catch_Up_Entry__Enhancing_USB_Anti-Forensic_Measures_And_Security

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Strengthen the security of the USB drive containing the Trading Robot Plug project, focusing on anti-forensic measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data remains secure and unrecoverable by others.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Implemented multiple security scripts on the USB drive, including:
    - **Self-Destruct Mechanism:** A script to automatically wipe the USB drive upon detecting unauthorized access or tampering.
    - **Dead Manâ€™s Switch:** A mechanism that triggers secure deletion if the USB is not used within a specified timeframe or under safe conditions.
    - **Advanced Secure Deletion:** Enhanced secure deletion scripts to overwrite file slack space and unallocated space, reducing the chance of data recovery through forensic tools.
    - **Custom Steganography and Data Encryption:** Added scripts for hiding sensitive data within innocuous files using steganography and encryption.
    - **Anti-Forensic Tools Integration:** Introduced anti-forensic tools to scramble metadata and file system information, making forensic analysis difficult.
    - **Environmental Validation:** Created a script to ensure the USB is only used in a secure and authorized environment.
    - **USB Protection and Monitoring:** Established monitoring scripts to detect and respond to unauthorized attempts to access or copy the USB drive.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenges:** Ensuring that all scripts function correctly without accidentally triggering data loss during normal use.
  - **Breakthroughs:** Successfully developed a mechanism for environmental validation that triggers self-destruction if the USB drive is used on an unauthorized system.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The enhanced security setup ensures that the Trading Robot Plug project remains protected against unauthorized access, forensic recovery attempts, and misuse. This robust setup aligns with the goal of commercializing the project while maintaining control over the "master" code.

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **PowerShell Scripting:** Utilized for creating and enhancing security measures, such as the self-destruct mechanism, USB protection, and environmental validation.
- **Python Programming:** Applied in developing encryption, steganography, and key management scripts.
- **Data Encryption:** Employed hybrid encryption methods to secure sensitive files on the USB drive.
- **Anti-Forensics:** Integrated tools and techniques to obscure metadata and scramble file system information, preventing forensic analysis.
- **Security Protocols:** Implemented multi-layered security protocols to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the project.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Developed a deeper understanding of advanced anti-forensic measures and their implementation using PowerShell and Python.
  - Recognized the importance of integrating environmental validation to prevent unauthorized use of the USB drive.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - Managing the balance between extreme security measures and usability, ensuring that security features do not accidentally lead to data loss.
  
- **Future Application:** 
  - Continue to refine and test the security scripts to ensure they are robust and reliable under all scenarios. Consider expanding these security measures to other critical storage devices.

---

## To-Do

- **Testing and Validation:** Conduct extensive testing of the implemented scripts to verify their effectiveness and reliability.
- **Backup Setup:** Establish a secure backup solution for the master code to prevent loss in case of accidental self-destruction.
- **Documentation:** Document the implementation of each security measure for future reference and potential updates.
- **Commercialization Strategy:** Develop a strategy for the commercial release of the Trading Robot Plug project, considering the security measures in place.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Self-Destruct Mechanism

```powershell
# File: self_destruct.ps1
# Description: Automatically wipes the USB drive upon detecting unauthorized access or tampering.
# Author: Your Name
# Date Created: 2024-08-13

function Self-Destruct {
    Write-Host "Unauthorized access detected. Initiating self-destruct sequence..."
    Remove-Item -Path D:\* -Recurse -Force
    Write-Host "USB drive has been securely wiped."
}

# Example trigger
if ($UnauthorizedAccessDetected) {
    Self-Destruct
}
```

### Data Encryption

```python
# File: data_encryption.py
# Description: Encrypts sensitive files and directories on the USB drive using hybrid encryption methods.
# Author: Your Name
# Date Created: 2024-08-13

import os
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC

def encrypt_file(file_path, key):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        plaintext = f.read()
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.GCM(os.urandom(16)))
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
    ciphertext = encryptor.update(plaintext) + encryptor.finalize()
    with open(file_path + '.enc', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(ciphertext)

# Example usage
encrypt_file('D:/SensitiveData.txt', b'secret_key')
```
