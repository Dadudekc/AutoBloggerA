# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Database_Configuration_And_Mock_Handling_Integration**

---

## Work Completed

- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Ensure correct MySQL database configuration and table structure for data storage.
  - Replace mock implementations with actual modules for seamless script integration.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Updated MySQL database credentials in the `alpha_vantage_fetcher.py` script to match the local environment.
  - Verified that the `stocks` table exists in the database with the correct schema.
  - Implemented logic to handle conditional imports based on the availability of modules in the environment.
  - Provided guidance on running the script to test database connection and data insertion.
  - Outlined steps for replacing mock imports with actual implementations when available.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - No major challenges were encountered. The key breakthrough was the realization that setting up a robust fallback mechanism with mocks allows for smoother development and testing phases, especially in environments where certain dependencies might not be available.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The script is now fully integrated with the MySQL database, capable of inserting stock data into the `stocks` table. The fallback mechanism ensures the script remains functional even in incomplete environments, which is crucial for ongoing development and testing.

---

## Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python Programming:** Used for script development, including API integration and data manipulation.
- **MySQL Database Management:** Configured database connections and ensured the correct schema for data insertion.
- **Asyncio for Python:** Leveraged for asynchronous data fetching from the Alpha Vantage API.
- **Logging:** Implemented logging to track script execution and troubleshoot issues.
- **Mocking:** Utilized Pythonâ€™s `unittest.mock` to handle missing imports during development and testing.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Gained insights into the importance of validating database connections and schema before data insertion.
  - Learned the benefits of using mocks in a development environment to simulate unavailable modules.
  
- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - No significant challenges were encountered during this session.

- **Future Application:** 
  - Future work will focus on enhancing the script's error handling mechanisms, particularly for database interactions. Regular database schema validation should be part of the integration process to avoid potential mismatches.

---

## To-Do

- **Database Validation:** Implement a function to check the schema of the `stocks` table before inserting data.
- **Refine Error Handling:** Improve error handling in the script to better manage exceptions during database interactions.
- **Real Imports:** Replace mock imports with actual implementations in environments where the necessary modules are available.
- **Logging Enhancements:** Enhance logging to include more detailed error messages and execution flow information.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Database Connection and Data Insertion

```python
# Establish MySQL database connection
def create_connection():
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host="localhost",
            user="root",
            passwd="your_password",  # Update with actual MySQL password
            database="trading_data"
        )
        logger.info("Connection to MySQL DB successful")
        return connection
    except Error as e:
        logger.error(f"The error '{e}' occurred")
        return None

# Insert fetched stock data into the database
def insert_stock_data(connection, stock_data):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    for index, row in stock_data.iterrows():
        query = """
        INSERT INTO stocks (symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
        """
        cursor.execute(query, (row['symbol'], row['date'], row['open'], row['high'], row['low'], row['close'], row['volume']))
    connection.commit()
    logger.info("Stock data inserted into the database")
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections

- **Improvement:** Consider adding a schema validation step before inserting data into the database to catch potential mismatches early.
- **Reflection:** The use of mocks during development has proven to be a valuable approach, allowing for flexible testing and iteration without being fully dependent on the availability of all modules.

---

## Collaboration and Communication

- **Meetings and Discussions:** No formal meetings were held during this session.
- **Decisions Made:** Decided to implement schema validation for the `stocks` table to ensure data consistency.
- **Action Items:** 
  - Self: Implement the schema validation function and improve error handling in the next session.

---

## Risk Management

- **Risk:** Potential mismatch between the expected and actual database schema could lead to data insertion failures.
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement schema validation before data insertion to ensure compatibility.

---

## Retrospective

- **What Went Well:** Successfully configured the MySQL database connection and ensured data insertion works as intended.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Further refine error handling and consider adding additional validation steps for database operations.
- **Actionable Insights:** Schema validation is crucial for preventing data insertion errors and should be integrated into the data handling workflow.
