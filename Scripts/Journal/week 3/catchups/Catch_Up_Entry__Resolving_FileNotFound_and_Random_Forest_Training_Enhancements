# Project Journal Entry

**Catch_Up_Entry__Resolving_FileNotFound_and_Random_Forest_Training_Enhancements**

---

## Work Completed
- **Objectives and Goals:** 
  - Resolve the `FileNotFoundError` encountered during data loading in the `random_forest_trainer.py`.
  - Enhance the `RandomForestModel` class with improved logging, feature engineering, and SHAP value plotting.
  
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Reviewed and corrected the file path used to load the `tsla_data.csv` file.
  - Implemented detailed error handling and logging throughout the `RandomForestModel` class.
  - Added methods for plotting feature importances and SHAP values to improve model interpretability.
  - Ensured that the project root and paths were correctly calculated and verified.

- **Challenges and Breakthroughs:** 
  - **Challenge:** Encountered `FileNotFoundError` due to an incorrect file path. 
    - **Solution:** Added checks to verify file existence before attempting to load it and adjusted the path based on the project directory structure.
  - **Breakthrough:** Successfully integrated SHAP value plotting into the `RandomForestModel`, providing better insights into model behavior.

- **Results and Impact:** 
  - The script now correctly locates and loads the `tsla_data.csv` file, eliminating the previous errors.
  - The enhanced `RandomForestModel` class now includes comprehensive logging and interpretability features, which will aid in debugging and understanding model performance.

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **Python Programming:** Applied for scripting and enhancing the Random Forest training process.
- **Logging:** Utilized Python's logging library to implement detailed logging for better debugging and transparency.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted feature engineering and data preprocessing for model training.
- **Machine Learning:** Trained and validated a Random Forest model with advanced hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Integrated SHAP for model interpretability, providing visual insights into feature contributions.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
  - Importance of verifying file paths and ensuring that necessary files are present before executing scripts.
  - Enhanced understanding of the SHAP library and its application in interpreting machine learning models.
  - Improved skills in error handling and logging, which contribute to more robust and maintainable code.

- **Unexpected Challenges:** 
  - The primary challenge was the incorrect file path, which was resolved by adding verification steps before data loading.

- **Future Application:** 
  - The lessons learned will be applied to ensure that all scripts include comprehensive error handling and logging. SHAP value integration will be considered for other models to enhance interpretability.

---

## To-Do
- **Complete Model Training:** Finalize the Random Forest model training using the corrected script.
- **SHAP Value Analysis:** Further analyze the SHAP values to gain deeper insights into the model’s decision-making process.
- **Integrate Enhancements:** Apply the enhanced logging and SHAP value plotting methods to other machine learning models within the project.
- **Documentation Update:** Update project documentation to reflect the changes and enhancements made during this session.

## Code Snippets and Context

### Random Forest Model Enhancements

```python
# Example of feature engineering in the RandomForestModel class
def feature_engineering(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Performs feature engineering on the input DataFrame."""
    try:
        self.logger.info("Starting feature engineering...")
        df['lag_1'] = df['close'].shift(1)
        df['lag_5'] = df['close'].shift(5)
        df['lag_10'] = df['close'].shift(10)
        df['rolling_mean_5'] = df['close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
        df['rolling_std_5'] = df['close'].rolling(window=5).std()
        df['RSI'] = self.calculate_rsi(df['close'])
        df = df.dropna()
        self.logger.info("Feature engineering completed.")
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error during feature engineering: {e}")
        raise
    return df
```

### Error Handling for File Loading

```python
# Checking if the file exists before loading
data_path = project_root / 'data' / 'alpha_vantage' / 'tsla_data.csv'

if not data_path.exists():
    logger.error(f"Data file not found at: {data_path}")
    sys.exit(1)

data = pd.read_csv(data_path)
logger.info("Data loaded successfully.")
```

## Additional Notes and Reflections
- **Improvement:** Going forward, ensure that all scripts have built-in checks for file existence and proper error handling to avoid interruptions during execution.
- **Reflection:** The integration of SHAP values into the Random Forest model has significantly improved the ability to interpret model predictions, which is a valuable addition to the project.
