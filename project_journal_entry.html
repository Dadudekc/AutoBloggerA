        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        The progress made today, particularly resolving the import errors and creating the project documentation, marks a significant step forward. It reinforces the importance of documentation and testing in maintaining a robust and well-organized project. Multitasking remains a challenge, but it’s also a reminder of my commitment to both my professional responsibilities and personal projects.

        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        Challenges:<br>Encountered issues with the Nasdaq API returning 404 errors. Need to verify the API endpoints and access credentials.<br>Ensuring that data filtering works correctly with sorted indexes was a bit challenging but resolved successfully.

        <h2>Project Milestones</h2>
        Today, I focused on getting the original files in my TradingRobotPlug project to work correctly. I encountered a major setback when the data fetching utility (`data_fetch_utils.py`) got deleted, so I had to recreate it from scratch.<br>Since the last update, I have focused on creating a project document, resolving import errors, and updating the file structure documentation. These steps were essential to ensure the project is well-documented and all components are functioning correctly.
