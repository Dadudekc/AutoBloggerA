            "paragraph": "Work Completed:\n- Explored the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into the existing stock market prediction framework.\n- Evaluated the benefits of RL for adaptive trading strategies, sequential decision-making, and handling complex environments.\n- Discussed the complementary use of traditional models (LSTM, neural networks, random forest, linear regression) with RL for a robust ensemble approach.\n- Developed a sample RL environment using the PPO algorithm and integrated it with traditional model predictions and market data.\n- Provided a detailed example code for implementing both pre-trained RL models and custom user-trained RL models.\n- Outlined the advantages and disadvantages of training RL models in-house versus allowing users to train their own models.\n- Proposed a hybrid approach offering pre-trained models with the option for user customization and training."
