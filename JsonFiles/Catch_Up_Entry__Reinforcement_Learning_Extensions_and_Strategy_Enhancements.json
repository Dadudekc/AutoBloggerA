Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) was considered to implement both cooperative and competitive agent strategies. We also discussed adding continuous learning techniques such as online learning and meta-learning. Moreover, expanding reward structures to include multi-objective optimization and risk-adjusted returns was proposed.\n",

A key breakthrough was the idea to encapsulate complexity by using pre-built templates and auto-configuration tools. This can streamline model setup while offering powerful customization options for more advanced users.\n",
