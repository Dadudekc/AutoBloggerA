Address the following points:\n- Objectives and Goals: The main objective was to enhance the documentation of the config_handling.py file by adding comprehensive docstrings to all functions and the ConfigManager class. This was done to improve the maintainability and understandability of the code.\n- Actions Taken: \n  - Reviewed the existing code structure.\n  - Added docstrings to all functions, including setup_logging, search_config_files, load_configurations, get_config_value, consolidate_log_paths, and the ConfigManager class methods.\n  - Ensured consistency in the formatting and structure of docstrings across the entire file.\n- Challenges and Breakthroughs: \n  - The challenge was to maintain clarity while ensuring that all necessary information was included in each docstring. The breakthrough was in striking a balance between brevity and detail, making the docstrings informative yet concise.\n- Results and Impact: \n  - The updated documentation will significantly ease future code maintenance and onboarding of new team members. It will also facilitate better understanding and quicker troubleshooting when working with the config_handling.py file."
